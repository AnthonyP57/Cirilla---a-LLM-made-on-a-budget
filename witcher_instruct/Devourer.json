Its lore is rooted in a Baba Yaga tale where a man stumbles upon a Devourer. This creature personifies childrens fears of a wicked witch. A scene in the game where Geralt protects a child from a Devourer underscores its terrifying nature.", "What is the connection between the Devourer and Baba Yaga?": "Originating from a Baba Yaga tale, the Devourer, or Black Annis, represents a perilous encounter for any traveler unfortunate enough to pass near its lair.

It has a dog-like appearance with its hair pulled back. This creature is the embodiment of childrens fears, resembling a menacing witch with a hooked nose, drooping breasts, and a swollen, wrinkled belly. Its open mouth curves into a spiteful grin, enhancing its terrifying presence, as illustrated in a flashback of Geralt defending a boy from it.", "Why are Devourers often referred to as night witches?": "Devourers, also known as night witches, resemble elderly, unattractive women and are notorious for their malicious behavior. They favor fresh, warm human flesh, but will consume carcasses. These creatures hunt in groups, or sabbaths, during the night. They are infamous for deceiving and tormenting their victims. However, stories of them flying on broomsticks at midnight and living in gingerbread houses are unsubstantiated.", "What does the Devourer feed on in Witcher 3?": "In Witcher 3, the Devourer is a Necrophage that scavenges near human settlements, often in caves and ruins. It incapacitates its victims before consuming them. The Devourer is immune to standard poisons and resistant to knockdowns, but vulnerable to silver and Necrophage Oil. It shares a relation with rotfiends and is typically found near corpses."}
