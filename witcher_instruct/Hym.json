{"What is the unique method by which the Hym in Witcher 3 torments its victims?": "The Hym, a specter in Witcher 3, torments victims by amplifying their guilt.

A silver sword with specter oil, as per Witchers exorcism method, can combat a Hym.", "Why are Hym considered one of the most dangerous demons in The Witcher 3?": "In The Witcher 3, Hym is a specter deemed as one of the deadliest demons. It torments its victims by feeding on their guilt and fear, driving them to madness or suicide. Traditional exorcism methods are ineffective against Hym, which can exist in various spheres, such as the real world and Gaunter ODimms dark plane. It remains invisible to everyone except its chosen victim.", "What spheres does the Hym inhabit in The Witcher 3?": "In The Witcher 3, the Hym, a type of specter, inhabits Spikeroog and Gaunters world. It torments its victims by feeding on their guilt, driving them to madness or suicide. The Hym doesnt physically attack but uses psychological torment. It can briefly be seen on the walls of an old homes basement during the looting of the sword Brokvar.", "How does the Hym differ from other specters in The Witcher 3?": "In The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, the Hym distinguishes itself from other specters by feeding off a persons guilt rather than haunting locations or individuals due to unresolved matters. This specter torments its victims to madness or suicide without direct attacks. It can be defeated either through direct combat or trickery, and is vulnerable to Moon Dust, Specter oil, and the Igni sign.", "Why can't Hym be exorcised traditionally in The Witcher 3?": "In The Witcher 3, Hym is a unique creature that feeds off a persons guilt, causing self-harm. Traditional exorcism fails as the Hym only departs after driving its host to insanity or suicide. The Witchers exorcism method involves confronting the Hym with a silver sword and specter oil or deceiving it. The Hym was once expelled when it found no guilt to feed upon."}
