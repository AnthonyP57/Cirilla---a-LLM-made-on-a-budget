Nonetheless, the horses appear to readily accept this name.", "Does the name 'Roach' have any connection to the character Vernon Roche in the Witcher?": "In the Witcher series, Roach is not directly connected to Vernon Roche. Roach is a term for a European freshwater fish and is the moniker Geralt uses for his horses. The resemblance between Roach and Roche is incidental, with no evidence of a relationship.", "What is the origin of the term 'roach' as it is used in the Witcher series?": "The term Roach in the Witcher series originates from the French word for rock. In Polish, the horse is called P\u0142otka, a smaller version of P\u0142o\u0107 which translates to roach. This term is feminine, reflecting Geralts preference for female horses. Its unrelated to the insect cockroach, the French name Roche, or the character Vernon Roche.", "Does Roach, the horse, die in the Witcher series?": "In the Witcher series, Roach does indeed meet her end. She sustains severe injuries in a battle with a chernobog, leading Geralt to euthanize her. Later, Geralt acquires a new horse from Yarpen Zigrin, which he continues the tradition of naming Roach."}
