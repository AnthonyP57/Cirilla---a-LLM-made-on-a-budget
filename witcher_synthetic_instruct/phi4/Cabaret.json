{"question": "What are the consequences of choosing different themes for renovating the Rosemary and Thyme during Dandelion's cabaret quest?", "answer": "When deciding on the renovation theme for the Rosemary and Thyme, if you allow Priscilla to choose and she picks Boudoir, Dandelion initially complains but later loves it because it was her idea. However, if you choose the Boudoir style yourself, Dandelion will express disappointment as he had envisioned something more theatrical."}
