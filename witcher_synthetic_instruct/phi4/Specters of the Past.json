{"question": "What is the recommended strategy to defeat all enemies in the 'Specters of the Past' battle in Thronebreaker: The Witcher Tales?", "answer": "The recommended strategy involves placing a Rivian Sapper on the melee row to eliminate all the barghests. Then, place a Rivian Onager to the right of the Sapper and end your turn without activating its ability. Next, position an Alchemist to the left of the Sapper and activate its ability on the Onager. Follow this by placing another Alchemist to the left and using its ability on the Sapper. Finally, use Epidemic to further weaken enemies before destroying the Beast with the Onager's ability."}
