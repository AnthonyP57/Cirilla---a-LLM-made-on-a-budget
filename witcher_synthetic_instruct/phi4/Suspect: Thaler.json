{"question": "What are the three clues Geralt needs to find in order to investigate Thaler, and how does each clue advance the quest?", "answer": "The three clues Geralt needs to find to investigate Thaler are: \n1. Clue #1: 'Thaler put Berengar's witcher equipment up for sale.' This is discovered by talking to Thaler about the confiscated witcher's silver sword. \n2. Clue #2: 'For a fence and a thug, Thaler has surprisingly extensive contacts, not only with thieves, but also among the affluent.' This clue can be found by speaking to a Mysterious man outside Thaler's house two hours after Dusk.\n3. Clue #3: 'The fence's circle of influence is really wide. It also includes city guards.' Jethro provides this information after Geralt gifts him Fisstech and they talk about the confiscated witcher's silver sword. \nFinding these clues allows Geralt to form a deduction regarding Thaler\u2019s involvement with Salamandra, influencing whether Thaler is deemed innocent or guilty based on Geralt's reaction to the suspect's justifications."}
