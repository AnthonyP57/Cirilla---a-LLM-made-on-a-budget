{"question": "What are some auditory Easter eggs found in The Witcher, and what do they reference?", "answer": "In The Witcher, there are several auditory Easter eggs. When walking past a townsperson, they may utter something humorous due to the randomness of these events. During Chapter II's boat cut scene from Vizima, you can hear music reminiscent of 'The Heat of the Day.' There is also a possible X-Files reference when Geralt says 'I wish to believe!' during a conversation with Vaska. Another Easter egg includes Thaler\u2019s remark about enemies trying to steal their women in the Posh Reception quest, which might be a nod to Duke Nukem's catchphrase."}
