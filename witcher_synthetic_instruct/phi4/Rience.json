{"question": "What actions did Rience take to find Ciri after the Slaughter of Cintra?", "answer": "After being instructed by Vilgefortz, Rience went through various locations such as Sodden and Brugge, tortured a druid from the Angren circle, killed a whole family in Riverdell, followed Dandelion to Velen and hid during his concert at Bleobheris, hired thugs to capture Dandelion for information, issued a contract for Geralt across the north, took a barge with Malatius and Grock Company to draw Geralt, tried to deal with Geralt using four brothers he hired, and partnered up with Leo Bonhart and Stefan Skellen's gang. Rience eventually pursued Ciri from Dun Dare up to Mil Trachta."}
