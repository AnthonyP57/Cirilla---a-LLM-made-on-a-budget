{"question": "What actions characterized King Radovid V's reign after his victory in the Third Northern War?", "answer": "King Radovid V's reign was marked by a strict and relentless rule, where he annexed the entire North into the Kingdom of Redania as its 'Protector'. The Royal Redanian Army attempted to suppress uprisings and opposition with force, engaging in battles against Aedirn, Mahakam, the Free Company of the Iron Falcons, and Skellige fleets for control over the Great Sea. Additionally, his reign was defined by severe witch hunts from 1272 to 1276, targeting mages, non-humans, herbalists, and soothsayers who were burned at the stake in large numbers."}
