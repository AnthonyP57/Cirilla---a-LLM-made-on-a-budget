{"question": "What were the main reasons for King Foltest's introduction of ius stapulae in Vizima, and what impact did it have on the city?", "answer": "King Foltest introduced ius stapulae to Vizima around 1266 between the First and Second Northern War. This regulation involved blocking all merchandise routes with inspection sites around the city and seizing any Redanian or Nilfgaardian goods that were to be sold within Vizima. The impact of this was significant as it allowed for control over trade entering the city, likely increasing revenue from trade taxes and inspections while restricting foreign influence by limiting the sale of Redanian or Nilfgaardian goods."}
