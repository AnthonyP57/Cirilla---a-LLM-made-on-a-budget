{"question": "How do bruxae typically attack their prey, and what makes them particularly dangerous to witchers?", "answer": "Bruxae are especially dangerous to witchers due to their ability to produce a piercing scream that generates a shockwave strong enough to knock even large men off their feet, making them easy prey. Additionally, they can deprive enemies of sight, allowing them to play cat and mouse with their victims. Bruxae also use their sharp claws for close-up attacks and have masterful control over blood circulation, rendering poisons and oils ineffective against them."}
