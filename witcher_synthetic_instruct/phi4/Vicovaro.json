{"question": "What are some notable aspects of Vicovaro's history and its relationship with the Nilfgaardian Empire?", "answer": "Vicovaro, originally influenced by Lower Alban tribes in ancient times, became part of the Nilfgaardian heritage. In the second half of the 12th century, despite being seized by Emperor Torres's armies who later retreated, Vicovaro chose to join the Nilfgaardian Empire voluntarily after witnessing Etolia's fate under Emperor Fergus. This voluntary alliance allowed Vicovaro to integrate Nilfgaardian culture and maintain its pride in its heritage. Additionally, during the Second Northern War in 1267, Vicovarian veteran shieldbearers marched alongside Etolian troops."}
