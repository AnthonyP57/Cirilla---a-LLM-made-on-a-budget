{"question": "What are some of the options Geralt has to help free Alina's spirit?", "answer": "To help free Alina's spirit, Geralt can seek advice from various sources: Dandelion, Berengar, Lady of the Lake, an old hermit in the fields, or a local soothsayer. He learns that Alina had a special mirror shattered into five pieces scattered throughout the fields, which must be reassembled by either the village blacksmith or an elven craftsman for 100 orens. Once reassembled, showing this mirror to Alina should help her realize she is dead, but if it doesn't work, further steps include consulting a poet like Dandelion or making a sacrifice with Adam speaking to Alina as only the dead can communicate with each other."}
