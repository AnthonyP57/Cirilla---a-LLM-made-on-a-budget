{"question": "Why is necromancy forbidden despite its proponents' arguments for its potential benefits?", "answer": "Necromancy is forbidden because, although the logic behind using it to revive corpses for uncovering secrets or reusing soldiers in battle seems sound, experience has shown that the revived dead are always unpredictable and reviving them always involves negative side effects. This leads to evil outcomes regardless of the mage's noble intentions, indicating a divine prohibition against transgressing natural laws."}
