{"question": "What are some of the key differences between ghouls and alghouls as described in the text?", "answer": "Ghouls, a sub-species found commonly in packs, are distinguishable from their cousins, alghouls, by their sickly pale visage. Ghouls tend to hunt locally, shredding prey with fangs and claws before leaving corpses to age, while alghouls lead groups of ghouls but have no specific hunting traits mentioned separately."}
