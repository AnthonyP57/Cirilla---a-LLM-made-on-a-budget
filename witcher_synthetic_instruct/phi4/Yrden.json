{"question": "How does upgrading the Yrden sign enhance its functionality in 'The Witcher' series?", "answer": "Upgrading the Yrden sign enhances its functionality by allowing you to place up to three yrden signs at a time and enabling multiple Yrden traps to work together, forming a barrier that enemies cannot pass through. Additionally, it allows the sign to wound and immobilize opponents, trap tentacles of the kayran in 'The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings', and increase its effectiveness by causing knock back, damage, and status ailments when foes traverse the magical trap."}
