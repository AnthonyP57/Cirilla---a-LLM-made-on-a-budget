{"question": "What are the possible outcomes if Geralt chooses to bring Syanna to Tesham Mutna, depending on whether she has a protective amulet or not?", "answer": "If Geralt brings Syanna and she has her protective amulet with the ribbon from Little Flint Girl, Dettlaff will be enraged and transported to safety when he tries to attack. This leads to him lunging at Regis and Geralt, ultimately resulting in his defeat and demise. If Syanna does not have the ribbon, she will die during the confrontation, giving Geralt the choice either to fight Dettlaff or let him go."}
