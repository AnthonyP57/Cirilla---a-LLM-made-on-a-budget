{"question": "What were the key events that led to the destruction of Tor Lara?", "answer": "The key events leading to the destruction of Tor Lara began with its foundation by the Aen Seidhe after the Age of Migration in the 1240s BR, when they constructed a grand complex and tower on Thanedd Island using magic. The Brotherhood of Sorcerers later took over the palace and began operating from there. Immanuel Benavent discovered the portal to Tor Zireael within the tower, but it was warped, causing chaotic transport for those who entered. Attempts to block up the portal led to protests among the Brotherhood. Ultimately, on July 1st, 1267, during a large-scale coup between members of the Brotherhood and factions from North or Nilfgaard, Ciri ran through the unstable portal and was ejected into the Korath desert. This action caused the magical explosion that destroyed Tor Lara."}
