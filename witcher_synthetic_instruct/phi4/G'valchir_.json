{"question": "What are the different methods to obtain G'valchir in The Witcher and how does it compare in terms of damage?", "answer": "G'valchir can be obtained by completing the 'Won't Hurt a Bit' quest for a reward from the dentist, as a possible reward from the Royal huntsman after defeating all ten trophy monsters in Chapter V, or through the Mud and Velvet quest where you must keep the money instead of returning it, which involves killing Captain Jean-Pierre. It can also be found on the Fields in Chapter IV but only in the original version (1.0) of the game. G'valchir is described as having high damage against humans with little effect on monsters and is the highest damage steel sword in The Witcher, equivalent to the silver sword Moonblade."}
