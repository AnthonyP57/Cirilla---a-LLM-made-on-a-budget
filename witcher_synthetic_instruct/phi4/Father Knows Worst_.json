{"question": "What happens if Geralt decides not to attack Hugo's brothers at the end of the 'Father Knows Worst' quest?", "answer": "If Geralt chooses not to attack the brothers, he finds that they were actually hunters coming to help. The three brothers, Lucien and Auguste Monnart along with Hugo, then decide to resolve their differences peacefully. If Geralt didn't find the filter for Hugo's part of the condenser, the brothers claim they found it themselves during his search. They pay the agreed reward, invite Geralt to The Clever Clogs Tavern, and this decision counts as 'Proof of Wisdom' for the quest There Can Be Only One."}
