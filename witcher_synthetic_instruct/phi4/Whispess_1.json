{"question": "What power does Whispess possess and how did she react to a knight in Chuchote Cave?", "answer": "Whispess has the ability to transform into a flock of crows, and like her sisters, can shapeshift into a young woman or the form of those they feed on. In Chuchote Cave, she saw that a certain knight's heart was black and refused him aid, which led him to burn her alive in anger."}
