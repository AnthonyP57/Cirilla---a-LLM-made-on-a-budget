{"question": "What are some strategies for maximizing the benefits of Euphoria in Blood and Wine, particularly in relation to increasing the toxicity pool?", "answer": "To maximize the benefits of Euphoria in Blood and Wine, players can combine it with mutations like Acquired Tolerance, which increases the toxicity pool by allowing alchemy skills into additional slots. Further enhancement is possible using Metabolic Control and Manticore School Gear, which further expand the pool capacity to 327 (or 332 in New Game +), raising damage and sign intensity limits to 245.25% (or 249% NG+). Additionally, utilizing Heightened Tolerance can prevent damage from high toxicity levels."}
