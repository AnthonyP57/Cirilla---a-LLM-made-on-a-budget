{"question": "What was Deglan's initial reaction when he saw Vesemir and Illyana steal blue gum, and how did he handle the situation?", "answer": "Deglan initially saw an opportunity for a good payout when he noticed 12-year-old Vesemir and his friend Illyana stealing blue gum, which he knew was used to help someone going mad. He tracked them down in an alley, took the herb from Illyana, but was surprised by her defiance towards him as a witcher. To resolve the situation, Deglan threatened to turn them in as thieves unless they led him to the noblewoman's estate he believed was suffering from madness, so he could treat her."}
