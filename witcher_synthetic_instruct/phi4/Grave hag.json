{"question": "What makes grave hags particularly dangerous to encounter at night?", "answer": "Grave hags are particularly dangerous to encounter at night because they venture out to hunt, moving and attacking with great speed. Their ability to quickly close on prey and the use of their long tongues in combat, which can cause temporary blindness if a victim is struck, make them formidable opponents in darkness."}
