{"question": "What are the key steps Geralt must follow once he reaches the Isle of Mists in 'The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt'?", "answer": "Once at the Isle of Mists, Geralt follows a magic firefly to navigate. He initially encounters Ekhidnae and tangalores. After reaching a hut on foot, Geralt finds three dwarves who inform him that Ciri is unconscious inside. To complete their objectives, he must find the missing dwarves Ferenc, Ivo, and Gaspard. Ferenc is already deceased due to a Fiend at his location; Ivo can be found high on a rock arch but falls during a cutscene, while Geralt rescues Gaspard from a lighthouse. After reuniting with Ciri inside the hut, Geralt brings her back outside where they are confronted by the Wild Hunt. Eventually, Ciri uses her abilities to teleport them to Kaer Morhen, concluding the main quest."}
