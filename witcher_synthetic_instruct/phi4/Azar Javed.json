{"question": "What were the key steps in Azar Javed's plan to create mutant soldiers for the Order of the Flaming Rose?", "answer": "Azar Javed, in collaboration with Jacques de Aldersberg, planned to take over the North by creating invincible warriors. They required witcher mutagens and formulas which they discovered through Berengar, a former monster slayer. Using this knowledge, Javed led an assault on Kaer Morhen to steal these secrets. After acquiring them, he set up his laboratory in Vizima's catacombs beneath the Old Manor to conduct experiments with mutation and alchemy, aiming to produce warriors with extraordinary abilities who were obedient to the Order of the Flaming Rose."}
