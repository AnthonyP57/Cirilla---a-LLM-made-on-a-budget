{"question": "What are the effects and uses of the Cat potion in The Witcher series?", "answer": "The Cat potion is a vital concoction for witchers, enabling them to see in total darkness which aids in navigating dark environments like caves or crypts without being surprised by nocturnal creatures. It allows witches to perceive both living beings and inanimate objects, even through walls. However, it slightly disrupts perception, reducing the damage dealt to monsters. This side effect can be mitigated using the Rook potion. Additionally, the Cat potion causes minor intoxication upon consumption. Over different iterations of The Witcher games, its uses have expanded: in The Witcher 2, Geralt starts with two Cat potions; in The Witcher 3, three can be crafted simultaneously. Notably, after Patch 4.0, it also increases critical hit chance."}
