{"question": "What are some key strategies and considerations when engaging the ethereals in the final room of the Ethereal memory section?", "answer": "To effectively engage the ethereals in the final room, consider the following strategies:\n\n1. **Understanding Ethereal Behavior**: Initially, there are six ethereals, but only one is active at a time. Attacking an inactive ethereal will cause it to wake up and fight.\n\n2. **Positioning**: Start by positioning yourself at the far end of the room. This allows you to draw in each ethereal one-by-one rather than fighting multiple at once.\n\n3. **Dodge-Hit Strategy**: Use a dodge-hit-dodge-hit rhythm when facing the active ethereal. This helps avoid taking too much damage while maintaining offensive pressure.\n\n4. **Quen Sign Usage**: Utilize the Quen sign extensively, ideally with the Active Shield upgrade, to absorb incoming attacks and sustain through the fight.\n\n5. **Parrying Techniques**: The final two ethereals can be parried after timing their powerful strikes correctly. Successfully parrying allows for a series of strong counter-attacks.\n\n6. **Simultaneous Combat (Optional)**: For those seeking an additional challenge, use Dancing Star bombs to stun all ethereals at once and concentrate your Whirl attack on them while they're grouped together, earning the 'When It's Many Against One...' achievement.\n\nBy employing these tactics, you can effectively manage and defeat the ethereals in this final stage."}
