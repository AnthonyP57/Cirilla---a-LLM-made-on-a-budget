{"question": "What are the three stages of the battle against Dettlaff in Tesham Mutna, and what strategies should a player use during each stage?", "answer": "The battle against Dettlaff in Tesham Mutna consists of three distinct stages. In Stage 1, Humanoid Form, Dettlaff employs ranged dash attacks and dodges after taking one hit; players can counter this by using a short-dodge-fast-attack pattern to deal quick strikes. During Stage 2, Flying Form, the player must be patient as Dettlaff is vulnerable only at specific points in his attack patterns; players should dodge dashing slashes with a roll and wait for moments when he dives onto the ground to use Aard, Igni, or crossbow bolts for damage. In Stage 3, Body Illusion, players find themselves inside Dettlaff's chest where they must destroy pulsing hearts while fending off blood clones; destroying these hearts provides time to focus on attacking them and defeat Dettlaff once three are destroyed."}
