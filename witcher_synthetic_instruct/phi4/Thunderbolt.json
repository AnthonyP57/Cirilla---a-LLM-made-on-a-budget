{"question": "What are the effects of imbibing the Thunderbolt potion in The Witcher series?", "answer": "Imbibing the Thunderbolt potion causes witchers to enter into a battle trance, making them attack more efficiently and deal greater damage while neglecting their own defense. It increases the damage inflicted on opponents by 100% but reduces dodging and parrying efficiency by 50%. Additionally, it may cause weaker muscle fibers to rupture, decreasing both Vitality and its regeneration, and significantly increases Toxicity when imbibed."}
