{"question": "In 'The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt', how can players obtain Quebrith, and what new functionality does it have in crafting compared to previous games?", "answer": "In 'The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt', Quebrith is needed for crafting specific items such as Superior Full Moon, Superior Golden Oriole, Superior Hanged Man's Venom, Superior Northern Wind, and Superior Thunderbolt. Unlike its role in previous games where it was part of other alchemical ingredients, players can obtain a guaranteed drop from the katakan encountered during Now or Never, or craft it themselves. Additionally, in the Blood and Wine expansion, Quebrith can be purchased from alchemists such as the Merchant at the Perfumery and Wine Merchants at Chuchote Cave and Dun Tynne Hillside after completing their respective quests."}
