{"question": "How did Count Falwick's interactions with Geralt of Rivia differ between the original story and The Hexer TV series?", "answer": "In the original story, Count Falwick was a noble member of the Order of the White Rose who trained Arthur Tailles. He attempted to have Geralt leave the duchy by ordering a duel with Tailles in Ellander but remained calm despite his dislike for the witcher.
