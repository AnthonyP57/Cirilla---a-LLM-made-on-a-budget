{"question": "What are some key aspects of Eskel's personality and abilities that distinguish him from Geralt, despite their similarities?", "answer": "Eskel is described as calm, patient, stable, thoughtful, and polite. Even when he disagrees with a topic, he feigns politeness and interest, often avoiding eye contact. He enjoys drinking and laughing with friends and is quite self-aware about his appearance but remains unaffected by it. A distinctive ability of Eskel's is that his hands emit powerfully with magic, more so than Geralt's. This magical aura causes a pleasant, piercing vibration in mages."}
