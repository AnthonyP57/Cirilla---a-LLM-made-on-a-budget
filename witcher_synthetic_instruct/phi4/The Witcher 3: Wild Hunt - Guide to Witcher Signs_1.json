{"question": "What is the purpose of the Aard Sweep upgrade for the Aard sign, and how does it enhance combat effectiveness against groups of enemies?", "answer": "The Aard Sweep upgrade allows Geralt to fire a wave of telekinetic energy downward that spreads out to affect a wider area. This version of the Aard sign can push back and potentially knock down opponents within its range, making it highly effective for crowd control. When upgraded with glyphs like Entanglement, it also significantly slows large groups of enemies, thereby enhancing Geralt's ability to manage multiple foes at once."}
