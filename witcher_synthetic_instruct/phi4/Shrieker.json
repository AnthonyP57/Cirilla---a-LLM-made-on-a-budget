{"question": "What are the recommended combat tactics for defeating the Shrieker in The Witcher 3?", "answer": "To defeat the Shrieker, players should use draconid oil and the Aard Sign, targeting its back since it has no rear attacks. It's advisable to maintain a position at its back to exploit this weakness. Additionally, while the Shrieker has strong frontal attacks that are hard to dodge due to little delay and a lengthy damage window, staying behind it can make the battle easier."}
