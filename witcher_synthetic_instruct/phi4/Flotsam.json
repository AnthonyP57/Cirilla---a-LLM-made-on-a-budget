{"question": "Who was administrating Flotsam in 1271, and what were some of its key features during that period?", "answer": "In 1271, Bernard Loredo was administering Flotsam. The town was a river port and trading post located along the upper course of the Pontar river, surrounded by inaccessible forests. It served as a hub where numerous trade routes converged and was near the Temerian-Aedirnian border. Although land travel in the region was difficult due to threats like Scoia'tael units, many travelers preferred sailing the river using various types of boats such as flat-bottomed barges, punts, scows, and seagoing cogs. Flotsam's economic importance came from its strategic position for trade among Aedirn, Kaedwen, Temeria, Redania, and Cidaris. The town had a small garrison responsible for law enforcement and protection against river pirates, Scoia'tael units, and monsters."}
