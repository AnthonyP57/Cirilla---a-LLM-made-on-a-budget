{"question": "What is the significance of the Wild Hunt's appearances in both The Witcher 3 and European folklore, and how do their characteristics reflect these themes?", "answer": "The Wild Hunt serves as a primary antagonist in 'The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,' where they are on a mission to capture Ciri. This aligns with its role in European folklore, where the Wild Hunt is often seen as an omen of war and catastrophe. The leaders of these hunts, such as Odin or Herla, are typically ominous figures associated with the underworld and death. In both the game and folklore, looking upon the riders or their horses (often depicted with six legs) is perilous and considered a bad omen, reflecting themes of impending disaster and doom."}
