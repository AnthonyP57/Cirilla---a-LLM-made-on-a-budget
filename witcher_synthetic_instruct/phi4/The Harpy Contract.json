{"question": "How can Geralt effectively use harpy traps to destroy harpy nests in The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings?", "answer": "Geralt needs to strategically place the harpy traps near a harpy and wait for it to grab and carry one to its nest, causing the nest's destruction. He should avoid arming two traps simultaneously until he receives credit for destroying a nest to prevent wasting traps. The traps must be placed in open areas to ensure they are not wedged against rocks, which could impede the harpies from picking them up."}
