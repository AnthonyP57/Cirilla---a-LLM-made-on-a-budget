{"question": "What are some effective combat tactics against basilisks in 'The Witcher'?", "answer": "Despite their appearance, basilisks can be effectively combated using fire-based attacks such as Igni and the Dancing Star bomb. A well-timed bomb or burst of Igni not only brings down a flying basilisk to ground level but also distracts it from defending itself. Basilisks are skilled at using their wings and talons in combat, similar to cockatrices, and can parry sword strikes with their wings before leaping into the air for devastating overhead blows or spitting acid from above."}
