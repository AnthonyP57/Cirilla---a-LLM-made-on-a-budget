{"question": "What actions did Berengar take after leaving Kaer Morhen, and how did these choices lead to his ultimate fate?", "answer": "After leaving Kaer Morhen, Berengar traveled across the Northern Realms accepting witcher contracts while searching for Raven's armor. His resentment towards witchers made it difficult for him to connect with others. He took a contract in the Outskirts of Vizima and later assisted Kalkstein in opening a tower in the Viziman Swamp. Eventually, he was coerced by Salamandra into finding Alvin due to threats from Azar Javed. Berengar's choices led him to team up with Geralt to confront Azar Javed. Whether spared or killed by Geralt earlier, his ultimate fate involved dying during their battle against Azar."}
