{"question": "What are some strategies Geralt can use to defeat a Be\u0142t in The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt?", "answer": "To defeat a Be\u0142t, Geralt should use the following strategies: First, he needs to immobilize it using a Yrden trap, as this creature is very fast and requires being stopped before vital points can be targeted. Once immobilized, Geralt can pierce its brain through an eye for an instant kill, which costs 4 points. Additionally, cutting the tumor on its forehead will disable its Mind Control ability at the cost of 1 point. The Be\u0142t is immune to Steel and Axii but vulnerable to Silver weapons, Fire spells, and Aard."}
