{"question": "What are the two types of Zireael swords mentioned in The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt and how do they differ?", "answer": "The two types of Zireael swords in The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt are a steel sword and a silver sword. The steel sword is used by Ciri during her quests, named after the original gnomish blade given to her by Leo Bonhart. It appeared with an exploit that allowed Geralt to obtain it until Patch 4.01. The silver sword appears in one of the endings if the Witcher ending is achieved; it has a silver-plated siderite steel core and can only be obtained by Geralt, intended as a fitting start for Ciri's witcher career."}
