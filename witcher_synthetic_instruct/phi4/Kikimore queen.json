{"question": "What strategy should players use to defeat the Kikimore Queen in the game?", "answer": "Players should run away from the Kikimore Queen and use the Aard sign to first collapse the passage, which slows down the queen. Then, they should destroy the supports of the Salamandra Cave with the Aard sign again, causing a section to fall on top of the Kikimore and kill it. Alternatively, experienced witchers might use Brown Oil, Quen, and Aard signs, or bombs like the Devil's Puffball and Dragon's Dream. The easiest method involves using Yeden with the Cripling Sign unlocked."}
