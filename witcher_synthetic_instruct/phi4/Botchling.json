{"question": "What is a botchling and how can it be transformed into a lubberkin according to the given text?", "answer": "A botchling is a small creature resembling a highly deformed fetus, created from the improper burial of unwanted, stillborn infants. It preys on pregnant women by hiding beneath beds, sapping their strength, and directly feeding off their blood once they are defenseless, resulting in the death of both the mother and unborn child. A botchling can be transformed into a lubberkin, which is a guardian spirit of the hearth, by performing the elven naming ritual known as Aymm Rhoin and giving it a proper burial beneath the family's threshold."}
