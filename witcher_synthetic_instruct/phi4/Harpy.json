{"question": "What makes harpies particularly dangerous during combat in 'The Witcher' series?", "answer": "Harpies are particularly dangerous during combat because they use their ability to fly, which allows them to dive swiftly and strike their victims one by one before soaring back up out of reach. Additionally, while on the ground, they can be more easily incapacitated but their ability to quickly regain flight makes attempts to knock them down often ineffective."}
