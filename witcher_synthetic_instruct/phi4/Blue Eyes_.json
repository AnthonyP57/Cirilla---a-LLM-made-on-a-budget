{"question": "What decision does Geralt face when he discovers Blue Eyes working at the brothel?", "answer": "Geralt faces a difficult decision upon discovering that Blue Eyes, Patrick de Weyze's sister, is working as a prostitute at the brothel. He must decide whether she is there by her own free will, choosing to become a vampire and remain young forever, or if she is being controlled by a vampire. This decision involves potentially siding with either the vampiresses controlling the brothel or Patrick de Weyze."}
