{"question": "What is speculated about Alvin's identity in relation to Jacques de Aldersberg?", "answer": "Many fans speculate that Alvin might actually be Jacques de Aldersberg, the Grandmaster. This theory is supported by Alvin's ability to teleport through time and space, suggesting he is a source like Jacques. Additionally, choices Geralt makes when advising Alvin in Chapter IV influence specific conversations with Jacques in the Epilogue, implying they share a core identity. The game 'The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt' later confirmed this theory."}
