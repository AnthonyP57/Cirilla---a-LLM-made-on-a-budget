{"question": "How is vermilion used differently in 'The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt' compared to previous games?", "answer": "In 'The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt', unlike previous games, vermilion is not just a part of other alchemical ingredients. It is needed to craft specific items like Superior Maribor Forest, Orange armor dye, Superior vampire oil, and Superior White Raffard's Decoction. Additionally, while in the base game it must be crafted, in the Blood and Wine expansion it can also be purchased from alchemists."}
