{"question": "Where can players find Dimeritium ore in The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt?", "answer": "Players can find Dimeritium ore as random loot throughout the entire game, as guaranteed loot in bandit camps, guarded treasures and treasure hunts in Toussaint, or purchased from various merchants. Some of these merchants include all armorers and blacksmiths except the one at Ardaiso Quarry, armors and weapons merchants in Nilfgaardian Army Group 'Center' Camp, the merchant in the boatyard south of Refugees' Camp, and several others located at specific locations like Calveit Watchtower, Coast of Wrecks, Ursten, and Kaer Trolde Harbor. Additionally, it can be obtained by dismantling many swords, particularly those of dwarven and gnomish origins or superior+ level witcher gear swords and gauntlets."}
