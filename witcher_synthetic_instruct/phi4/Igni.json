{"question": "What are some key strategies for effectively using the Igni sign in 'The Witcher' series?", "answer": "To use the Igni sign effectively in 'The Witcher' series, players should recognize its potential as a powerful tool of mass destruction. Initially mediocre, it consumes a lot of Endurance but can become Geralt's most devastating attack once upgraded. It pushes enemies back, sets them on fire for Damage over Time effects, and provides crowd control by making humanoids panic. Igni is especially effective against foes weak to fire. An alternative form allows a continuous flow of fire rather than a quick burst. Additionally, it can ignite flammable gases in the air to cause explosions that damage and stun enemies."}
