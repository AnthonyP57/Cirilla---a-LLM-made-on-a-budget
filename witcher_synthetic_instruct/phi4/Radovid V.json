{"question": "What were King Radovid's plans for his neighboring kingdom Temeria, and how did they change based on Geralt's actions?", "answer": "King Radovid of Redania had specific plans for the neighboring chaos-riddled kingdom of Temeria. He aimed to partition Temeria in order to prevent the Empire from acquiring its lands, thereby strengthening Redania's position. His strategy was to use the turmoil within Temeria to his advantage. However, Geralt's actions influenced these plans. If Geralt chose to give Ana\u00efs La Valette, King Foltest's illegitimate daughter, to Radovid, it provided Radovid with a strong argument for making Temeria a Redanian protectorate through skilled political maneuvering. On the other hand, if Geralt decided to give Ana\u00efs to John Natalis, Temeria's regent, Radovid had to find another way to expand his dominion."}
