{"question": "What new gameplay mechanics are introduced in Blood and Wine, and how do they enhance Geralt's experience?", "answer": "Blood and Wine introduces several new gameplay mechanics that enrich Geralt\u2019s experience. One notable addition is the armor dyeing mechanic, which allows players to change the color of witcher gear using dyes found or purchased within Toussaint. Additionally, Blood and Wine features 12 game-changing abilities known as Mutations, which can be unlocked through research mechanics and further enhanced in New Game+ mode. These Mutations provide unique enhancements such as healing Geralt upon death with damage immunity, allowing critical hits from signs to cause enemies to explode, and enabling opponents knocked down by Aard to freeze and die instantly."}
