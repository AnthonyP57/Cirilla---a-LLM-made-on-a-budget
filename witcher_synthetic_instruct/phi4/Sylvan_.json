{"question": "How do sylvans interact with humans, and what are some of the consequences of these interactions?", "answer": "Sylvans typically have limited interaction with humans, often playing harmless but bothersome tricks and eating crops. Humans generally dislike them for this reason and sometimes resort to force when fooled by their awkward appearance. This can lead to tragedy because sylvans are strong and agile, and they emit a powerful and extremely unpleasant scent that even witchers find difficult to tolerate."}
