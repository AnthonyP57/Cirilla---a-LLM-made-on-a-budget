{"question": "Why might a witcher choose to use Virga despite its limitations?", "answer": "A witcher might choose to use Virga because it increases resistances to Poisoning, Incineration, and Bleeding, making the witcher less vulnerable to monsters' powerful special attacks. This defensive advantage is particularly beneficial in battles against creatures that cause Bleeding, are venomous, or breathe fire."}
