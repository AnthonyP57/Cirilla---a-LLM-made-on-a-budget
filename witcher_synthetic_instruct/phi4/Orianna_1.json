{"question": "How did Geralt defeat Orianna when they encountered each other again?", "answer": "Geralt defeated Orianna by drinking a Black Blood potion before the fight. This caused her powers to diminish once she consumed his poisoned blood, allowing him to gain the upper hand, sever her left arm, and eventually shoot her twice in the back with his crossbow."}
