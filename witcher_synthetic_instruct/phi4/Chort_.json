{"question": "What is a common misconception about chorts according to legends, and how does reality differ?", "answer": "Legends often mistake chorts for sylvans, attributing to them abilities like speaking, standing on two legs, gobbling up cabbage, playing pranks, and causing mischief. In reality, chorts do not speak and communicate with grunts, snorts, and moans. They walk on four legs and are known for destroying farmsteads, devouring anything edible including animals and humans if available."}
