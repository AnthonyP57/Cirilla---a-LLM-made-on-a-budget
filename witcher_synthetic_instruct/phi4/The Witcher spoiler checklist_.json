{"question": "How can a player obtain all three unique women's cards in 'The Witcher' video game?", "answer": "In the game 'The Witcher', players have an opportunity to unlock different women's cards by making specific choices throughout their playthrough. To obtain all three unique women's cards, one must complete multiple playthroughs as follows:\n\n1. **Toruviel Card** - This card is exclusive to the Scoia'tael path. Players need to make decisions aligning with this group in one playthrough.\n2. **White Rayla Card** - Exclusive to the Order Path, players must choose actions supporting this faction in another separate playthrough.\n3. **Nurses Card** - This card is available when following a Witcher or Neutral path. Players should complete decisions favoring neither the Scoia'tael nor the Order exclusively in yet another playthrough.\n\nEach card can only be obtained once per playthrough, requiring players to replay the game and make different choices each time to collect all three."}
