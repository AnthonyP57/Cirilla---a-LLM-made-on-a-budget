{"question": "What actions did Horst Borsodi take to gain favor with King Radovid V?", "answer": "Horst Borsodi gained favor with King Radovid V primarily by selling war bounty at his auction house. His efforts were successful enough that he managed to get into Radovid V's inner circle and secured a squadron of Redanian Guards to protect the auction house without having to pay taxes, as Radovid granted him a taxation rate of zero percent."}
