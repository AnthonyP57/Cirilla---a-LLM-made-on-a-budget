{"question": "What was the original purpose of Kaer Morhen and how did its role change over time?", "answer": "Originally, Kaer Morhen served as a keep where witchers of the School of the Wolf were trained. It underwent significant transformations over time: initially speculated to have been an ancient elven defensive structure, it was rebuilt by the Nordlings in the late 11th century and became the primary training ground for young wolf witchers. The Laboratorium beneath the castle was used for Trials and Changes that transformed boys into witchers. Over time, with dwindling monster populations and increasing anti-witcher sentiments, fewer young witches were trained there, eventually leading to its decline as a training site by the late 1230s or early 1240s. Despite this, it continued to be used as a gathering place for adult witchers during winters."}
