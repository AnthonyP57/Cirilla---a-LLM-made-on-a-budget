{"question": "What did Aelirenn use as her banner, and how was it perceived by other races?", "answer": "Aelirenn used a simple circle as her banner. This represented the globe and symbolized the scope of her ambitions. The other Elder Races \u2013 dwarves, halflings, and gnomes \u2013 looked upon this standard with unease, not knowing what might happen to them if Aelirenn achieved victory. Meanwhile, humans laughed at it because they believed the world was flat."}
