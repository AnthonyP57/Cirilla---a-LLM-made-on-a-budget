{"question": "How do nekkers organize themselves during an attack, and what is the significance of chieftains within their groups?", "answer": "Nekkers generally attack in large numbers by striking en masse. They burrow from beneath the ground to swarm their prey, aiming to surround them quickly and cut off escape routes. Despite being disorganized due to a lack of courage among individual nekkers, they are effective because of their agility and acrobatics. Within their groups, chieftains play a crucial role as leaders who organize otherwise wild bands into coordinated units. These larger, red-clay-marked individuals give orders during war or hunting parties, making them important targets for players aiming to disrupt the nekkers' attack strategy."}
