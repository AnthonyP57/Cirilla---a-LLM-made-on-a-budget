{"question": "What are some ways Geralt can use the Quen sign effectively during combat?", "answer": "Geralt can use the Quen sign in various effective ways during combat, such as buying time to imbibe a potion or regain vitality by resting. He can also switch weapons during a fight or when charging at enemies with ranged attacks. Upgrading Quen allows it to reflect damage back to attackers and sustain multiple hits before breaking. Light Armor users can cast Quen repeatedly due to swift stamina regeneration, keeping them protected throughout the battle."}
