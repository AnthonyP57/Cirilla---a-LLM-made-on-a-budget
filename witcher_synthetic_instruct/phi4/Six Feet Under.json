{"question": "What is Geralt's task in Chapter III of 'Six Feet Under', and what options does he have upon encountering Vetala?", "answer": "In Chapter III of 'Six Feet Under', Geralt is tasked by Siegfried to investigate mysterious disappearances in Vizima's Cemetery. Upon reaching the necropolis, he finds evidence of ghoul activity but discovers a more sinister situation with the corpse of a woman who was stabbed and not eaten. Geralt encounters a talking ghoul named Vetala, and at this point, he has two options: to kill Vetala or spare his life. If he chooses to spare Vetala, Vetala informs him that an elven unit is responsible for the disappearances, leading Geralt to find and confront them. Conversely, if Geralt kills Vetala, it is assumed that Vetala was behind the murders, concluding this part of the quest."}
