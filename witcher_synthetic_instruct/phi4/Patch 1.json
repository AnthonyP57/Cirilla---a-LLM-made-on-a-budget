{"question": "What were some of the key fixes related to gameplay mechanics introduced in Patch 1.30 of The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt?", "answer": "Patch 1.30 addressed several gameplay mechanics issues, including fixing a problem where oil descriptions remained on swords and resolving an issue that prevented obtaining certain dye recipes. It corrected the ability to skip the entire second phase of the Eredin fight, ensured a silver sword was no longer needed for crafting the Mastercrafted Legendary Griffin Steel Sword, and fixed difficulties in defeating two NPCs from the 'Without a Trace' quest. Additionally, it made Rabid Rock Trolls less aggressive on the 'Just the Story' difficulty level, addressed issues with underwater bolt switching and Adrenaline Rush buff values during bandit fights, tweaked loot randomization, ensured correct adrenaline generation upon killing blows, and resolved Roach's vanishing tail issue. It also corrected various item, quest, and NPC level discrepancies in New Game + mode."}
