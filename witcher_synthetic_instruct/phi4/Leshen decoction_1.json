{"question": "How does the Leshen decoction's 'punishment' effect work in The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt?", "answer": "The Leshen decoction reflects damage back onto attackers, and unlike most similar effects, it reflects the exact amount of damage received by Geralt. This means that even if Geralt takes no damage due to protections like Quen, the full reflected damage is still dealt to enemies. However, as of Patch 4.0, this applies only to a flat 10 damage effect; the 10% damage reflection depends on actual damage taken."}
