{"question": "What change was made to the Piercing Cold mutation in Patch 4.0 regarding the freezing chance, and how does this affect its effectiveness?", "answer": "In Patch 4.0, the freezing chance when the Aard Sign is cast with the Piercing Cold mutation increased from 25% to 30%. This change allows the freezing chance to scale with available adrenaline points. However, despite this increase, the mutation's overall effectiveness is questionable because the damage does not adapt to the player's level and appears less effective due to adjusted resistances of enemies."}
