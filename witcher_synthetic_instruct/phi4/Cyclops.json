{"question": "What are some of the combat tactics recommended for fighting a cyclops in The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt?", "answer": "To fight a cyclops effectively, a witcher should avoid standing in one place and instead move to the side or behind to evade attacks. It is advised not to stand close when a cyclops raises its hands as it can flatten anything with its ground-pound. At longer ranges, a witcher should be cautious of the cyclops' ability to leap into the air. The Axii Sign can temporarily confuse a cyclops, allowing for recuperation time. Using Yrden Sign helps in dealing more damage when within sword range, and Quen is considered the best protective sign for handling these monsters."}
