{"question": "What transformation did Luis Alberni undergo when he approached the Lady of the Lake?", "answer": "Luis Alberni's body and equipment began to change drastically as he approached the Lady of the Lake. The slender knight grew more corpulent until his horse could no longer bear him. His sword first became wooden, then a mace, and his shining armor turned dull and to ash. Finally, all he had left was his helmet, which transformed into a wooden cage. Upon seeing his reflection in the lake's waters, Alberni realized he had become a giant named Golyat."}
