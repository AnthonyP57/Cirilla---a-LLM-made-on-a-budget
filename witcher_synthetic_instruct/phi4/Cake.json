{"question": "How can Geralt obtain the Cake item in the Blood and Wine expansion?", "answer": "To obtain the Cake item, Geralt should start the quest 'Turn and Face the Strange'. Upon reaching a room with several gargoyle statues, he must dispose of one that attacks. After looting the statue and dropping its item on the nearby pedestal, portals will open up. Geralt should enter the portal facing the first level's statue to reach the second level, then go through the opposite portal. From the third level, he needs to find a portal that is blue but also glowing orange below him, descend to the second level via a break in the railing, and enter this portal to discover a room with a small chest containing the Cake."}
