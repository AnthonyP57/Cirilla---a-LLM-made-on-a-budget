{"question": "What led to Berengar harboring resentment towards witchers, and how did this affect his interactions with others later in life?", "answer": "Berengar harbored resentment towards witchers because he blamed them for subjecting him to mutations and depriving him of the chance to live a normal life. This resentment affected his interactions with others by making it difficult for him to connect with people, as they often had disdain and mistrust toward witchers. His bitterness was evident in his confrontations with Geralt and other characters throughout his journey."}
