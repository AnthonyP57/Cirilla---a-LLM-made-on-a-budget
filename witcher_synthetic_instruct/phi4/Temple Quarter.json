{"question": "What is the current state of the Temple Quarter in Vizima, and how has it changed due to recent events?", "answer": "The Temple Quarter in Vizima has been transformed drastically by the uprising of non-humans. Fires are rampant across the area, and many streets have been blocked by makeshift barricades. The region is a battleground where Scoia'tael clash with the Temerian army and knights of the Order. Due to these conflicts, many inhabitants have fled to the swamps or hidden in cellars and houses, seeking refuge from the chaos. The upheaval has also drawn missionaries and evangelists who are preaching about divine wrath and the end of the world."}
