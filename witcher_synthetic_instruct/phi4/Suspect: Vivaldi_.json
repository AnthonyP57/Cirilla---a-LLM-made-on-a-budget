{"question": "What are the three main clues Geralt can use to deduce Golan Vivaldi's guilt or innocence, and where does each clue originate from?", "answer": "The three main clues Geralt can use to deduce Golan Vivaldi's guilt or innocence are: (1) Vivaldi's dislike for humans, which is learned from a journal entry of characters about him seeing the worst in humans during business dealings. This clue is discovered by talking to a random Dwarf near Vivaldi's house in 'Little Mahakam'. (2) The money for The Professor's bail came from Vivaldi's bank, allowing the criminal to walk free; this clue is obtained by discussing it with Jethro about the Professor. (3) Vivaldi has relations with nonhumans, including Scoia'tael, which is learned from Yaevinn in the Druids' grove when asked about work for witchers."}
