{"question": "What happens if Geralt ignores the portal in 'Wandering in the Dark' quest?", "answer": "If Geralt ignores the portal, he will remain in the main chamber and begin his search for Keira from there. This approach may be preferable to going through the portal because it avoids being teleported to a cavern far from the main chamber. Instead, Geralt would need to fight drowners and foglets to get back to the main chamber to find Keira."}
