{"question": "What method did Geoffrey Monck reportedly use to control djinns, and how was this connected to their wishes?", "answer": "Geoffrey Monck reportedly captured numerous djinns and kept them in bottles or jars. It is suggested that he had a way of forcing them to serve him by having more than one djinn under his control. A common belief was that freeing a djinn from its jar would grant the person three wishes, but this required also possessing the magical seal."}
