{"question": "How do the physical appearances of different kikimore castes reflect their roles within the colony in The Witcher game?", "answer": "The physical appearances of kikimores are designed to highlight their roles in the colony. Workers, who build structures and supply food, resemble spiders but aren't obviously similar; they have limbs and cephalothoraxes that evoke repulsion due to their shape. Soldiers, responsible for defending the colony, look like beetles with thick chitinous armor, horned heads, sharp thorns on their legs, and a bulky build indicating danger. The queen resembles the soldiers but is even bulkier, serving as a constant reproducer without eyes or limbs necessary for defense."}
