{"question": "What steps must Geralt take to ensure Hattori can return to being a master swordsmith in 'Of Swords and Dumplings'?", "answer": "Geralt must first talk to Hattori at his dumpling shop. Then, he needs to meet Hattori's supplier on the docks after dusk and help him negotiate for supplies. Geralt will face an ambush by Cleaver's men, which he must escape. Afterward, he enlists Sukrus from Skellige as a bodyguard for Hattori. Geralt also breaks up a fight outside The Golden Sturgeon and either convinces or destroys goods related to Sukrus' brother-in-law. Using his Witcher Senses, Geralt locates and marks crates with crafting supplies in van Hoorn's warehouse, then gathers Sukrus and his men to take the marked crates. Finally, Geralt must defeat Ernst van Hoorn and his thugs before returning to Hattori to discuss the promised sword, completing the quest after checking back later for a reward."}
