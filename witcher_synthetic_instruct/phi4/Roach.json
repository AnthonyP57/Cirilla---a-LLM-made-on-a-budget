{"question": "What is the significance of the name 'Roach' for Geralt's horses in The Witcher series, and what are its origins?", "answer": "The name 'Roach' that Geralt gives to all his horses comes from the roach (Rutilus rutilus), a common European freshwater fish. The name is not related to the cockroach but shares an origin with the French word for rock, 'roche', which also relates to the English term 'roach'. In Polish, the original name 'P\u0142otka' means both 'roach' and 'small fry', and as a diminutive form of 'P\u0142o\u0107,' it is endearing. This gendered Polish term aligns with Geralt's preference for mares, making 'Roach' suitable mainly for female horses. However, the alternate meaning 'small fry' makes it gender-neutral in usage."}
