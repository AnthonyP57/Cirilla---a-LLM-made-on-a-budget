{"question": "How did King Foltest handle the economic challenges posed by cheap Nilfgaardian goods entering Temeria?", "answer": "King Foltest responded to the economic challenge posed by cheap Nilfgaardian goods by issuing the law in the cities of Vizima and Gors Velen, known as ius stapulae. This prevented the movement of Nilfgaardian goods through those cities' merchandise routes, although he could not close the southern borders due to potential anger from the Merchant's Guild."}
