{"question": "Why was necromancy distinct at Ban Ard Academy compared to other schools?", "answer": "Necromancy was distinct at Ban Ard Academy because it was taught there even though the Brotherhood had banned it elsewhere. The academy allowed profound studies of necromancy, but delving too deeply into the forbidden art could lead to expulsion."}
