{"question": "How can Geralt deduce whether Golan Vivaldi is guilty or innocent in the suspect quest?", "answer": "Geralt can deduce Golan Vivaldi's guilt or innocence by investigating clues through questioning and forming a deduction. There are three main clues: Vivaldi's dislike for humans, financial involvement with The Professor's bail, and relations with nonhumans including Scoia'tael. Geralt must decide whether to believe or disbelieve each clue during his interrogation of Vivaldi. If he believes all claims, Vivaldi is deemed innocent; if none are believed, Vivaldi is guilty. No conclusion can be reached otherwise."}
