{"question": "What are the two possible outcomes when Geralt decides to take his money back immediately after confronting Giacomo Cianfanelli at the Cianfanelli Bank?", "answer": "If Geralt tries to get his coin right away and wins against the guards, he ends up collecting as much coin as he could but is no longer allowed to convert coins at the bank. Alternatively, if Geralt is beaten by the guards after attempting to take his money back immediately, he still gets 200 from Giacomo Cianfanelli and becomes a persona non grata in that establishment."}
