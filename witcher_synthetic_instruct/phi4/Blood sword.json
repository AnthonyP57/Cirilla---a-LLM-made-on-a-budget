{"question": "Where can players find the Blood Sword in the game, and what are the conditions for obtaining it based on their alignment with factions?", "answer": "The Blood Sword is found inside a chest in the southeastern chamber of the Tunnel of the Founders beneath Vergen. It is guarded by a Bullvore. Players can obtain it if they side with Iorveth at the end of Chapter I and play before entering the cave with Saskia on the Xbox version, or if they side with Roche, during Hatred Symbolized while meeting up with Saskia and Zoltan. For PC versions, players on Iorveth's path cannot access the sword as the relevant portion of the Tunnel is inaccessible."}
