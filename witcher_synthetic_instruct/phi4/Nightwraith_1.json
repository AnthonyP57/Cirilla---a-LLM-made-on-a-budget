{"question": "What makes nightwraiths particularly dangerous despite their seemingly weak appearance?", "answer": "Nightwraiths are particularly dangerous because, although they appear as pale and withered women in tattered dresses, they can become corporeal only momentarily to strike. When weakened, they create multiple projections of themselves which act as transmitters to sap the victim's vital energy, making them quite harmful despite their weak appearance."}
