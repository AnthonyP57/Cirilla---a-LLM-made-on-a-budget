{"question": "What are some notable bugs encountered during this quest, and how can they be mitigated?", "answer": "There are several bugs noted in the quest:\n\n1. **Mislabeling of Ghosts**: During the fight with the von Everec ghosts, all except Alexy are incorrectly labeled. For example, Honoratina is labeled as Eulalia and Kestatis as Ernest. This bug appears mainly during cutscenes.\n\n2. **Unique Walking Stance**: When playing as Vlodimir at the party, Geralt uses a unique walking stance with his hands on his hips. Saving and creating a New Game + save over this can make this stance permanent throughout the game.\n\n3. **Disabling Dynamic Beard Growth**: Prior to Patch 4.0, removing Geralt's facial hair by Vlodimir might disable dynamic beard growth even if the face is clean-shaven. This issue can be resolved by visiting a barber and choosing the 'Shaved head and a ponytail' option.\n\n4. **Missing Letter in Inventory**: The letter written by Vlodimir, which should appear in Geralt's inventory to give to Olgierd, often doesn't show up. However, it can be added using console commands for players who wish to read it.\n\nTo mitigate these bugs:\n- For the mislabeling issue, while there\u2019s no direct fix, being aware of it helps manage expectations during gameplay.\n- To prevent the unique walking stance from becoming permanent in New Game +, avoid saving at this point if you do not want this glitch to carry over.\n- Re-enable dynamic beard growth by visiting a barber and selecting specific grooming options after any facial hair removal incident caused by Vlodimir's actions.\n- Use console commands to add the missing letter back into your inventory for players encountering that particular bug."}
