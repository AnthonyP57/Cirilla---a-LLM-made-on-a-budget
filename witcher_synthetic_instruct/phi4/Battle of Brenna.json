{"question": "What was the strategic mistake made by Menno Coehoorn during the Battle of Brenna that contributed to his defeat?", "answer": "Menno Coehoorn's strategic mistake was gathering his remaining troops (the Nauzicaa and 7th Daerlan brigades) to attack where the elves were, without anticipating Bronibor\u2019s infantry fighting bravely against a larger foe. As a result, on the left flank, Nilfgaard's army was in ruins while at the center front they were losing to the Nordling armies. The Nauzicaa brigade was surrounded and destroyed, and the 7th Daerlan Brigade was defeated by PFI and the Free Company, leading to the entire Nilfgaardian Army being either defeated or surrounded."}
