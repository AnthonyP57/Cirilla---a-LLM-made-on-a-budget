{"question": "What symbol identified the Scoia'tael and what was its significance?", "answer": "The Scoia'tael were identified by a squirrel tail attached to their hats or other parts of their garments. The choice of this symbol is significant as it reflects their agility and nimbleness in the forest, although ironically, squirrels are on the brink of extinction in regions with great Scoia'tael presence."}
