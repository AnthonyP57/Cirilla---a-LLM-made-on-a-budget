{"question": "How do shaelmaars navigate their environment, and what is a recommended tactic for disorienting them during combat?", "answer": "Shaelmaars navigate by sensing vibrations and listening for sounds due to their blindness. A recommended tactic for disorienting them during combat is to use the Aard Sign or a bomb (like Samum) to cause the shaelmaar to slam into an obstacle at full speed, lowering its fighting ability."}
