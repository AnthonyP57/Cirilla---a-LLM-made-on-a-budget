{"question": "What are some of the limitations of a witcher's medallion as described by Vesemir in 'The World of the Witcher'?", "answer": "According to Vesemir, witcher medallions have several limitations. They can be affected by very strong magical auras found at Places of Power or during solstices, which may cause aberrant reactions. Additionally, in large cities where simple magical amulets and sorcerous alarm systems are common, the medallion can behave abnormally. Certain monsters like dopplers and higher vampires remain undetected by the medallions."}
