{"question": "What role did Imlerith play in the Battle of Kaer Morhen and how did it affect the witchers defending the keep?", "answer": "Imlerith was one of the generals of the Wild Hunt who participated in the Battle of Kaer Morhen. His presence forced Geralt's hunting party to retreat inside the keep, where they closed the main gate as Imlerith furiously pounded his mace against it. The Hunt broke into the heart of Kaer Morhen, freezing everyone but Ciri and Vesemir. Imlerith engaged Vesemir, allowing Eredin to get a hold of Ciri. Despite Vesemir's efforts, Imlerith killed him by snapping his neck, which led to a pivotal moment in the battle."}
