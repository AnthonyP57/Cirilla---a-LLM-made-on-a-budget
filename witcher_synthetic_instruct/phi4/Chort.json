{"question": "What are some of the combat tactics recommended for fighting a chort in 'The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt'?", "answer": "To effectively combat a chort, it's advised to use their size and speed against them by baiting them into charging, rolling aside, and hoping they run headlong into an obstacle. This can leave the chort vulnerable as you then have the opportunity to attack its flanks while it recovers. Additionally, using Devil's Puffball bombs to poison a chort is recommended; dragging it through toxic fumes will force it to breathe in the poison, potentially resolving the fight quicker. While not weak to fire directly, burning them can be an effective tactic."}
