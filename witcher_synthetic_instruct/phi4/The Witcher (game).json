{"question": "What are the three fighting styles available to players in The Witcher, and how do they differ?", "answer": "The three fighting styles available in The Witcher are quick style, heavy style, and group style. The quick style allows for faster, less-damaging attacks with a greater chance of hitting faster enemies; the heavy style deals more damage in exchange for slow attack speed and a lower chance to hit faster enemies; while the group style features sweeping attacks best used when surrounded."}
