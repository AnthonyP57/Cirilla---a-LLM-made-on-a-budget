{"question": "What were the key motivations and actions taken by Emhyr var Emreis that led to his conquest attempts in the North, and how did he plan to use his daughter Cirilla (Ciri) to achieve his ambitions?", "answer": "Emhyr var Emreis, also known as Deithwen Addan yn Carn aep Morvudd ('The White Flame Dancing on the Graves of His Foes'), was driven by near-unparalleled ambition and a desire to rule not just Nilfgaard but the entire world. Historians have speculated about his motivations, suggesting they included expanding Nilfgaardian influence through new lands for settlement or responding to pressures from merchants and traders. Regardless, Emhyr's ambitions led him to launch multiple military campaigns into the North, crossing the Yaruga river three times.\n\nTo realize his ultimate goal of world domination, Emhyr required a unique asset: his daughter Cirilla (Ciri), who was believed to be the Child of the Elder Blood. This made her central to his plans, as she possessed prophetic powers and destiny that could aid in achieving his ambitions. Emhyr's intentions for Ciri were clear; he wished to use her not only due to their bloodline connection but also because of her abilities which aligned with his grandiose schemes. However, it was ultimately his conscience, stirred by a profound realization or inner conflict, that stopped him from fully enacting his plans involving Ciri."}
