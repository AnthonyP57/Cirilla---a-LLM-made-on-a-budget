{"question": "What are the main differences between silver swords and steel swords used by witchers in terms of their properties and usage?", "answer": "Silver swords are primarily used against monsters, especially those vulnerable to silver like the undead and other magical creatures. They have a steel core coated with a thick layer of silver that is lethal to these creatures but ineffective on humans and nonhumans. On the other hand, steel swords in The Witcher can be bought or sold and do not have any special properties making them effective against specific types of enemies."}
