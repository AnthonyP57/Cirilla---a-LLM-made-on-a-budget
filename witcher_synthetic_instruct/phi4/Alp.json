{"question": "What are some unique characteristics that differentiate alps from other vampire species like mulas, bruxae, and higher vampires?", "answer": "Alps are similar to mulas and bruxae but seem less powerful than bruxae. They can be hurt by silver weapons or chains and tan to almost black when exposed to sunlight for too long. Unlike bruxae, alps cannot turn invisible, although they share the ability to emit a shrieking noise that incapacitates others. Alps are agile, with the ability to leap with lightness that resembles flight, but unlike bruxae, they prefer dodging over blocking in combat."}
