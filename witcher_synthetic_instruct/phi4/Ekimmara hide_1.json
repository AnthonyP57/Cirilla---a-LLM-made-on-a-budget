{"question": "Where can players find ekimmaras in The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, and what is their significance?", "answer": "Players can find all three ekimmaras at specific quest locations in The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt. They appear in the mill during the quest 'Following the Thread,' in Dragonslayer's Grotto during 'Scavenger Hunt: Griffin School Gear,' and as part of 'Contract: The Mystery of the Byways Murders' with Sarasti.
