{"question": "What role did the Caretaker serve at the von Everec estate, and how was he controlled?", "answer": "The Caretaker served as a golem-like servant tasked with caring for the house and protecting it from intruders. He performed these duties pedantically by tending to the flowers, repairing fences, tidying the yard, and eliminating any intruders by murdering them and burying their bodies beyond the manor garden's bounds. The Caretaker was controlled through magic that forced him into servitude."}
