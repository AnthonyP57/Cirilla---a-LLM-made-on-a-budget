{"question": "How did Alzur demonstrate his valor during an encounter with bandits, and what was the outcome?", "answer": "Alzur stepped in to confront robbers attacking a wagon as part of his 'trial' for valor. He ended up beaten, bloody, and unconscious on the side of the road for hours. Instead of waiting for opportunities, he actively sought them out, leading to another occasion where he was found standing over the charred remains of three would-be bandits by his family."}
