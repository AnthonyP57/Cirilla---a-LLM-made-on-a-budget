{"question": "What were the main reasons Assire var Anahid was considered unattractive by the standards of her time, and how did she differ from typical Nilfgaardian sorceresses?", "answer": "Assire var Anahid was considered unattractive due to her pale face with poor complexion, expressionless eyes, thin bluish lips, a somewhat crooked nose, and dark hair that didn't look very fresh. Additionally, she had hands marked by yellow spots, broken and uneven fingernails from biting them. She wore shapeless black robes with an embroidery of a half-moon within a circle of stars on her shoulders, complemented by a strange, conical hat. Unlike typical Nilfgaardian sorceresses who were often unkempt and wore unfashionable attire, Assire wore well-cut dresses and used just the right touch of makeup to underline her beauty, following the example of northern sorceresses."}
