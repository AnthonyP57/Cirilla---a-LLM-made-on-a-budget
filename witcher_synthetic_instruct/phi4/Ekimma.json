{"question": "What unique characteristics distinguish ekimmaras from typical vampire depictions?", "answer": "Ekimmaras, unlike traditional vampire portrayals of handsome aristocrats with charming accents, resemble overgrown bats and are post-Conjunction creatures. They display a highly vicious nature, tearing their victims to shreds with sharp claws rather than delivering delicate bites. Additionally, they are indifferent to garlic, holy water, or religious symbols, and possess the ability to become invisible and regenerate health over time."}
