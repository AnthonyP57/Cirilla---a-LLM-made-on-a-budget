{"question": "Why did Dol Blathanna's status change from a kingdom to an autonomous duchy within Aedirn?", "answer": "After the Second Northern War, King Demavend III of Aedirn acknowledged Dol Blathanna but as a duchy rather than a kingdom. He requested that Dol Blathanna pay tribute and grant equal rights to humans and elves. Francesca Findabair agreed to most conditions except paying tribute and accepted lowering its status to a duchy."}
