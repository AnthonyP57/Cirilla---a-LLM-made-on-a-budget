{"question": "What was Nibbles' original purpose in the game and how did his role expand over time?", "answer": "Nibbles, a cat character in the game, was initially introduced as a filmmaking trick to serve as a distraction during the Family Matters questline. The technical necessity arose when Tamara Strenger needed a diversion while descending stairs before meeting Geralt for the first time. A cinematic artist and quest designer added Nibbles sitting on a table, where he interacted with Geralt through exchanging stares. Over time, Nibbles proved endearing to the team, leading them to give him more roles in the game. Despite not being part of any bigger plan or magical role, Nibbles became an internet legend and a beloved character for fans."}
