{"question": "How did Eskel come to have his distinct facial scar, and what was its impact on his life?", "answer": "Eskel acquired his distinctive semi-circular facial scar from an unexpected source: a blade wielded by Deidre Ademeyn, who was his 'Unexpected Child.' This traumatic event had significant personal repercussions for Eskel. The incident not only marked him physically but also contributed to his deep-seated aversion toward Yennefer of Vengerberg. Despite this internal struggle, Eskel endeavored to maintain a cordial relationship with Geralt of Rivia, who was close friends with Yennefer. The scar itself became an emblematic feature of Eskel's character in 'The Witcher' series, symbolizing both his resilience and the personal challenges he faced throughout his life."}
