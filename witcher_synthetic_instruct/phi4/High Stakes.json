{"question": "What are the consequences of losing a match during the High Stakes quest in The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt?", "answer": "Losing or drawing a match during the High Stakes quest will cause you to fail the side objective Collect 'Em All, as this requires winning all matches. Additionally, if any match is lost before hearing Sasha's proposal, the last portion of the quest becomes unavailable and it fails. However, losing does not prevent completion of the 'To Catch a Thief' segment where Geralt can reclaim the prize money."}
