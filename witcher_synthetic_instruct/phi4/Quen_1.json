{"question": "How does upgrading Quen affect its capabilities during combat?", "answer": "Upgrading Quen increases its Sign Level, granting increased duration and damage absorption. It also causes the shield to reflect back 20/50% of the absorbed damage to attackers. If enhanced with the 'Enhanced Quen Sign' skill from the Magic tree, it can even reflect damage to up to three opponents at level two."}
