{"question": "How can Geralt find Putrid Grove in The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt?", "answer": "Geralt has several methods to find Putrid Grove. One way is by locating a thief in one of three search areas and carefully following him to the theater, leading to the grove's entrance. Alternatively, he can ask a beggar on the wooden scaffolding near Vimme Vivaldi for directions and the password 'Old sow...' to gain entry. Lastly, Geralt can find a sewer entrance near Glory Gate, navigate through until reaching drowners around a body, kill them, loot a key from the body, unlock a grate, climb up a ladder, defeat any thieves he encounters inside, and enter the grove without earning extra points."}
