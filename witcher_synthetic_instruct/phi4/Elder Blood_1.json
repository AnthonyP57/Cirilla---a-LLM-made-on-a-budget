{"question": "According to the text, how did researchers' assumptions about the lineage of elder blood carriers contribute to their errors?", "answer": "Researchers assumed that only 'official' or well-known children of carriers were potential inheritors of the elder blood, such as Ciri being the sole inheritor. They missed other possible premarital or extramarital children who might also carry the trait. This oversight led them to believe they had tracked all lines of the main elder blood gene when in fact they had only been following a limited subset."}
