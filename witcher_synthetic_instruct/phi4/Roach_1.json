{"question": "How does Geralt describe his relationship with Roach, and what are some unique behaviors or characteristics mentioned about her?", "answer": "Geralt is very attached to Roach despite sometimes being annoyed by her behaviors. He never wants to trade her for any other horse, even though she can panic in battle, turn unexpectedly during full gallop, stand helpless before low obstacles, and occasionally dance on a peasant's roof. Geralt attributes these traits to Roach's constant contact with the magical aspects of his witcher lifestyle."}
