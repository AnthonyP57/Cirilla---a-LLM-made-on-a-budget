{"question": "What is the backstory of the draug encountered by Geralt in 'The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings', and what does this reveal about its nature as a monster?", "answer": "The draug encountered by Geralt is actually the wraith of Vandergrift, known as \"the Visitor,\" who led the Kaedweni forces in a previous battle between Kaedwen and Aedirn. The draug retains the charisma it had while alive, commanding deathly subordinates like wraiths and revenants. It represents a powerful enemy rooted in ancient legends, embodying themes of curses and vengeance from beyond. This backstory emphasizes that the draug is not merely a physical threat but also a creature tied to tragic events, making it a complex opponent requiring more than just conventional means to defeat."}
