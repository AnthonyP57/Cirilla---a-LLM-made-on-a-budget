{"question": "Why did Deglan and Reidrich attempt to create crossbreeds, and what was one outcome of their experiment?", "answer": "Deglan and Reidrich attempted to create crossbreeds because they were worried that witchers had become too effective at their job, leading to a scarcity of monsters. To keep witchers in demand and prevent people from trying to kill them, they sought to engineer new threats by creating crossbreeds. One outcome of their experiment was the kidnapping of an elven woman named Kitsu, who they tried to splice with a mahr's genes, but the experiment failed, leading to her disposal."}
