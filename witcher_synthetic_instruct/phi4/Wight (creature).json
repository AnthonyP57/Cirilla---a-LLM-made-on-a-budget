{"question": "What is the best strategy when fighting a wight according to the text?", "answer": "The best strategy when fighting a wight is to take out the monsters guarding it with the Axii sign before attacking the wight itself. This approach leverages the vulnerability of the wight's summoned barghests, which obey the wight and attack anyone it deems a foe. Once these guardians are dealt with, the wight can be attacked directly."}
