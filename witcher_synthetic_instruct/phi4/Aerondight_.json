{"question": "How can Geralt regain Aerondight in the Blood and Wine expansion, and what are the unique characteristics of its damage system?", "answer": "Geralt can regain Aerondight by completing the quest 'There Can Be Only One' in the Blood and Wine expansion. This requires having completed quests encompassing all five chivalric virtues. A unique aspect of Aerondight's damage system is that it grows stronger with use; its strength increases permanently each time Geralt kills an enemy with a full charge, which can be accumulated through fast and strong attacks. The sword starts with no slots but can have up to 3 added for Runewords. Once fully charged, killing an enemy results in a small golden flash that boosts the weapon's damage by 2."}
