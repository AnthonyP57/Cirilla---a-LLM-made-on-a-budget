{"question": "What were the two reasons mentioned for why the battle is referred to as the 'Battle of Brenna' rather than the 'Battle of Old Bottoms', despite Brenna being burned down during the conflict?", "answer": "The battle is referred to as the 'Battle of Brenna' for two main reasons: first, Brenna was rebuilt and became a large and prosperous settlement while Old Bottoms did not resist the ravages of time and disappeared. Second, the name 'Old Bottoms' did not seem fitting for such a famous and tragic battle where more than thirty thousand men laid down their lives."}
