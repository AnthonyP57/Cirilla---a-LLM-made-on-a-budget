{"question": "What are the main differences between a witcher's silver sword and steel sword in terms of their uses?", "answer": "A witcher uses two swords: the silver sword and the steel sword, each serving distinct purposes. The silver sword is primarily used for combating supernatural enemies that are vulnerable to silver, such as necrophages, therianthropes, cursed ones, shapeshifters, wraiths, and vampires. It's made from meteoric iron coated in silver with magical runes inscribed on it. On the other hand, the steel sword is employed when raw physical power is necessary for fighting humans and non-humans that are not susceptible to silver."}
