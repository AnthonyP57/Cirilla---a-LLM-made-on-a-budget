{"question": "How do alps incapacitate their targets, and what are some recommended combat strategies against them?", "answer": "Alps incapacitate their targets by injecting a somniferous substance that causes nightmares, or they emit a shrieking noise whose shock wave can incapacitate. Recommended combat strategies include using the Yrden Sign to weaken their defenses and drinking Black Blood potion to prepare for their vampiric abilities. Additionally, knocking them down with an Aard sign may allow you to finish them in one strike if executed quickly."}
