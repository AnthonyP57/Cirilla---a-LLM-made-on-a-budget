{"question": "What are the key events leading up to and following Geralt of Rivia\u2019s apparent death on June 6 or 7, 1268, during the Northern Wars?", "answer": "The sequence of events surrounding Geralt of Rivia's apparent demise is pivotal in the timeline of The Witcher series. Here's a detailed breakdown:\n\n1. **June 1-2, 1268:** During the Second Northern War, there was an attack on Stygga Castle and a subsequent assault that led to significant battles.\n   - These conflicts were part of the ongoing turmoil between the Northern Kingdoms and Nilfgaard.\n\n2. **June 6 or 7, 1268 (The Rivian Pogrom):** Geralt was reportedly killed by an angry peasant mob in a tragic event known as the Rivian Pogrom. This occurred during heightened tensions where locals turned violently against individuals associated with witchers and magic.\n   - At this time, Yennefer of Vengerberg tried to heal him but appeared to die in the process. Both Geralt and Yennefer were then transported by Ciri to a pocket dimension for healing and to live away from the tumultuous world.\n\n3. **September 22, 1268:** Joanna Selborne testified before imperial officials about events from earlier that year, adding context to the political and social tensions of the period.\n   - Her testimony likely touched on incidents related to witchers and magic, as these were sensitive subjects during this time.\n\n4. **End of the Second Northern War (Post June 1268):** The Peace of Cintra was signed in early April, marking the end of hostilities. This treaty brought temporary stability to the region but did not resolve underlying tensions concerning witchers and magical beings.\n   - Geralt\u2019s absence during this time contributed significantly to the lore and mysteries within the series, leaving a lasting impact on characters like Ciri and Yennefer who found themselves navigating these complex dynamics without him.\n\nThese events underscore the volatile nature of the world in The Witcher series, where political intrigue, war, and personal vendettas often intersect with Geralt\u2019s story. His disappearance became a focal point for other key narrative developments, particularly concerning Ciri and Yennefer's paths."}
