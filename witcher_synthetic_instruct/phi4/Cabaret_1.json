{"question": "What are the different ways Geralt can help Dandelion with his cabaret renovation plans, particularly concerning Rautlec's predicament?", "answer": "Geralt has several options to assist Dandelion and resolve Rautlec's debt issue as part of the cabaret quest. First, he can choose to fight Polly's fianc\u00e9, Hubio, or persuade him to let Polly work for Dandelion. Secondly, Geralt can go to Silverton where bandits are collecting debts from an artist named Rautlec. The player can either offer to race in place of Rautlec and win the bet (earning 25 points), pay off Rautlec's debt of 200 (and lose 20 points), or leave him to his own devices, giving up on getting the placards for Dandelion. If Geralt races and wins, he gets a Mastercrafted saddle in addition to resolving the debt issue, but if he loses, he can either pay an increased debt or abandon Rautlec."}
