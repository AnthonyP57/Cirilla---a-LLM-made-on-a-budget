{"question": "What role did Bernard Ducat assume in Vizima after Foltest left the city, and what was his plan involving documents?", "answer": "After King Foltest left the city of Vizima, he put Thaler (Bernard Ducat) in charge. Thaler began to gather intel by posing as a fence and sold witcher equipment found by Coleman to the guards. Later, using his real identity, Bernard asked Geralt for a favor to retrieve a mysterious letter which confirmed someone was forging documents pretending to be Foltest. The letter supposedly from Foltest stripped Thaler of his position but lacked the king's signature."}
