{"question": "What motivated the Scoia'tael to start a guerrilla war during the First Northern War?", "answer": "The Scoia'tael were motivated to start a guerrilla war due to deep-seated racism and discrimination against nonhumans in the Northern Kingdoms. They hoped that by attacking trade caravans and northern army regiments, they would support Nilfgaard's invasion and possibly reinstate elven rule if all humans were defeated."}
