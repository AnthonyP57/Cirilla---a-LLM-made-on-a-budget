{"question": "What are some of the notable changes to Temeria\u2019s borders and economy following the First and Second Northern Wars?", "answer": "Following the First and Second Northern Wars, Temeria expanded its borders as far south as Angren and Riverdell, reaching the Amell mountains. However, the kingdom also suffered an economic blow that forced it to purchase goods from its southern neighbor. The influx of cheap Nilfgaardian goods passing through Temeria further damaged the economy."}
