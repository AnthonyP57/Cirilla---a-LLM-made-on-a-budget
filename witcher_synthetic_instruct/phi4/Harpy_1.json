{"question": "What makes harpies a preferred target for mages seeking magical items?", "answer": "Mages are interested in the items created by harpies because these creatures steal dreams, particularly those laden with strong emotions like recurring nightmares, and enclose them in crystals. These crystal-encased dreams radiate magic strongly, making them highly desirable to mages."}
