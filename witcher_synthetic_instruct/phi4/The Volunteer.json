{"question": "What are the two main options Geralt has when encountering Trollololo in The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt?", "answer": "Geralt can choose to either kill Trollololo or let him live by helping him paint a Redanian coat of arms. If Geralt kills Trollololo, he gains experience points and loot from the troll's body. If he decides to help Trollololo with painting, he must first purchase red and white paint for him and then deliver it."}
