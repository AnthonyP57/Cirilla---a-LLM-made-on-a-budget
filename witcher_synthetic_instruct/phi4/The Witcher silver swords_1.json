{"question": "What makes silver swords distinct from other types of swords like steel, meteorite, and rune swords used by witchers?", "answer": "Silver swords are distinct because they cannot be bought or sold, unlike steel, meteorite, and rune swords. They have a steel core coated with a thick layer of silver that is effective against magical creatures such as the undead but has little effect on humans and nonhumans."}
