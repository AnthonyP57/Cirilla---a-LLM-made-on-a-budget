{"question": "What is the purpose of the Aard Sweep upgrade for the Aard sign, and how does it differ from its standard usage?", "answer": "The Aard Sweep upgrade allows Geralt to fire a wave downward that spreads out in every direction when using the Aard sign. This mode can damage and potentially knock down enemies within a 10-yard radius plus an additional 2 yards for each level of the upgrade, differing from the standard usage which targets a single opponent."}
