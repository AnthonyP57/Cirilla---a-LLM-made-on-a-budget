{"question": "What are some combat tactics recommended for dealing with a giant centipede?", "answer": "The best way to deal with a giant centipede is to use the Yrden Sign trap; it paralyzes the centipede and prevents it from burrowing, allowing you to land several hits. It's important to target the front of the centipede as attacks from behind are largely ineffective. When the centipede curls into a protective loop after being hit multiple times, you should roll away because this guard move will do little damage, and it might soon perform a wide sweeping attack before burrowing to reappear elsewhere."}
