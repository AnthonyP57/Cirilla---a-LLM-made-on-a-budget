{"question": "What are the key events predicted by Ithlinne's prophecy regarding the end of the world?", "answer": "Ithlinne's prophecy predicts several key events leading to and following the end of the world. It foretells a global cooling that will bring about an ice age, known as 'The Wolf's Blizzard'. During this time, referred to as Tedd Deire\u00e1dh or the Final Age, the world will perish amidst frost and chaos. The prophecy describes this period as the Time of Madness and Disdain, marked by conflict akin to a long war or return to barbarism, involving swords and axes. Following the end of the world, it is prophesied that the world will be reborn with a new sun, rejuvenated from 'the Elder Blood' of Hen Ichaer through a seed that bursts into flames rather than sprouting. Elven survivors are expected to endure, saved by an offspring known as the Swallow."}
