{"question": "What are the different castes of kikimores in The Witcher game, and how do their roles within a colony compare to other social insects?", "answer": "In The Witcher game, there are three castes of kikimores: the queen, the warrior, and the worker. These creatures are organized similarly to a termite colony. The queen's primary role is reproduction; she lays eggs from which soldiers and workers hatch. The warriors defend the colony against enemies, while the workers are responsible for building structures and supplying food. This division of labor is reflected in their AI behaviors: workers become aggressive only when attacked or when aggression is artificially induced, whereas soldiers will attack any enemy they encounter."}
