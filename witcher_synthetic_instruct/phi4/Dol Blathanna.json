{"question": "What was the reason behind Iorveth's support for Saskia, the Virgin of Aedirn, according to 'The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings'?", "answer": "Iorveth supported Saskia, the Virgin of Aedirn, because he believed that the Pontar Valley might be the first suitable place for elves to flourish without persecution. He saw Dol Blathanna as having no future due to most of its inhabitants being old and sterile, and Francesca Findabair's obligation to sacrifice the Scoia'tael to their execution at the hands of other Northern monarchs."}
