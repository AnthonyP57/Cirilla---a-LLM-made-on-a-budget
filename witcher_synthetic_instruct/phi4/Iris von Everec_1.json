{"question": "How did Geralt manage to calm Iris' spirit and what was the significance of her 'painted world'?", "answer": "Geralt managed to calm Iris' spirit by gathering up her remains and burying them in the manor's garden. This act led to a transformation where Iris, now in a quieter state, guided Geralt on a journey through a world that existed only in her mind, known as the 'painted world'. This world consisted of her fears and memories, which Geralt had to confront. The significance of this painted world lies in its representation of Iris' unresolved emotions and deepest fears, particularly related to her husband Olgierd. It was through confronting these elements that Iris could finally accept what happened and decide on the fate of the violet rose."}
