{"question": "What was the primary reason for Sigismund Dijkstra's fall from favor with King Radovid of Redania?", "answer": "Sigismund Dijkstra fell out of King Radovid's favor due to his involvement and subsequent failure during a coup attempt on Thanedd Island, where he found himself in direct conflict with Geralt.
