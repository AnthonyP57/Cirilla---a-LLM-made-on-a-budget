{"question": "What was Eredin Br\u00e9acc Glas's ultimate goal and how did his character traits aid in pursuing this objective?", "answer": "Eredin Br\u00e9acc Glas, the King of the Wild Hunt, aimed to open the gate between worlds. This goal would allow the Aen Elle to seize control of the Continent, escaping their doomed world without traversing realms of frenetic timelessness and bitter cold. Eredin's character traits played a crucial role in pursuing this objective: he was ruthless, calculating, and ambitious. These traits enabled him to employ fear-mongering tactics effectively, such as wearing ghostly armor to appear as specters and using the ship Naglfar to haunt the waters of Skellige. His ability to leverage human legends and superstitions meant that his riders rarely needed to draw weapons, as their foes would often surrender out of terror alone. Eredin's leadership and strategic use of psychological warfare thus facilitated his pursuit of this ultimate goal."}
