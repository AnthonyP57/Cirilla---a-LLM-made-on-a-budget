{"question": "What are some notable characteristics and behaviors of trolls as described in 'The Witcher' series?", "answer": "Trolls are giant, humanoid creatures known for their intelligence and ability to communicate with humans using simple sentences. They often reside under bridges they build themselves, demanding tolls from travelers. Trolls have thick skin made like stone but possess muscles and blood beneath it. Despite a common belief that they are petrified by sunlight, trolls actually prefer daylight over night. They can be formidable in combat due to their accuracy with rocks, protection against arrows, and quick regeneration abilities. However, they are vulnerable to venoms because of their fast metabolism. Trolls are also fond of building and alcohol, often drinking the money earned from collecting tolls."}
