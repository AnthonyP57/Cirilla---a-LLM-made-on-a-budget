{"question": "What led to the establishment of the Faithel warrior order in Zerrikania?", "answer": "The establishment of the Faithel warrior order was prompted by the failure of an expedition led by Priestess Saulrenith. She and her team, consisting of six priestesses and six warrioresses, set out to search for remaining dragons and spread their faith. They were massacred by a dwarven band hunting for a green dragon, which motivated Queen Merineaevelth to create the Faithel order tasked with finding and protecting holy creatures."}
