{"question": "How does Euphoria interact with Acquired Tolerance and what is the impact on the toxicity pool in Blood and Wine?", "answer": "Euphoria is a mutation that allows abilities from the Alchemy tree to be added to additional slots, enhancing combat effectiveness. When used in conjunction with Acquired Tolerance, which also originates from the Alchemy tree, it increases the toxicity pool significantly. At maximum Acquired Tolerance, the toxicity pool can reach 267 (or 184 in Patch 4.0), raising the limit to 200.25% damage and sign intensity increase (or 138% in Patch 4.0). This combination is particularly beneficial because Acquired Tolerance not only boosts the toxicity pool but also fits into the additional slots due to its Alchemy origin."}
