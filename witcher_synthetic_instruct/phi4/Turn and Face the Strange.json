{"question": "What must Geralt do to unlock mutation abilities in the 'Turn and Face the Strange' quest?", "answer": "To unlock mutation abilities, Geralt must locate Professor Moreau\u2019s laboratory by following a trail of footprints at Orl\u00e9murs Cemetery with his Witcher Senses. Inside the lab, he should find megascope crystals on a desk and bench to place on a pillow near the megascope, then activate it to learn about Moreau's failed experiments. Afterward, Geralt must collect mutated giant centipede albumen from a nearby cave, use the machine that looks like an iron maiden to apply the albumen, and finally activate the crystal with Aard to open a portal leading out of the laboratory."}
