{"question": "Where are alghouls typically found, and what makes them more dangerous than normal ghouls?", "answer": "Alghouls are typically found in crypts, cemeteries, swamps between the Kezath obelisk and the collapsed tower, and Vizima cemetery. They are more dangerous than normal ghouls due to their larger size, strength, colorings, higher intelligence, and ability to lead ghoul packs with forethought. This makes them capable of coordinated attacks on travelers, caravans, and farmsteads."}
