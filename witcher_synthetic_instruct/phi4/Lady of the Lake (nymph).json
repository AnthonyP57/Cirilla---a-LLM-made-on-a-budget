{"question": "Who are some of the key figures associated with the Lady of the Lake in The Witcher series, and what roles do they play?", "answer": "In The Witcher series, particularly in 'Blood and Wine' expansion for The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, several key figures are closely associated with the Lady of the Lake. These include the Hermit and the Fisher King who serve her actively rather than merely as worshipers. The Hermit's duty is to guard over the kurgen (bones) of knights who died defending the Lady's honor. The Fisher King assists in transporting worthy individuals on his island using a boat. Additionally, Duke Guillaume de Launfal and Anna Henrietta mention that the Lady bestowed true chivalry upon Toussaint and cursed Sir Luis Alberni into becoming the giant Golyat for violating his vows."}
