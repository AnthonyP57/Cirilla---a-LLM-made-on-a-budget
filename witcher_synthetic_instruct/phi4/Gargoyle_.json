{"question": "What makes gargoyles in 'The Witcher' series particularly dangerous to opponents?", "answer": "Gargoyles in 'The Witcher' series are extremely dangerous due to their immense size and strength, being etched out of granite or marble. They can withstand significant damage and exhibit superhuman strength; a single blow from their boulder-like fists can crush even heavily armored individuals. Additionally, they possess the ability to throw stones with deadly precision and leap into the air to crash down on opponents, both of which are used to stun and harm targets. Another dangerous attack is their ground stomp, capable of stunning and partially blinding nearby threats due to its force."}
