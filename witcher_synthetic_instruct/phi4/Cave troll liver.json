{"question": "Where can you find a rabid rock troll that is guaranteed to drop cave troll liver in The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt?", "answer": "Rabid rock trolls are found in several locations within The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt and they all guarantee dropping cave troll liver. These locations include slightly east of the stone ruins in the forest southeast of Kaer Muire, at the bridge southwest of the Crossroads in southern Velen after clearing a nearby bandit camp, in the monster den northwest of the Border Post (guarded by nekkers), when first reaching the Trail to Yngvar's Fang fast travel point, and during the day south of Ard Skellig's Crossroads after destroying a drowner nest and meditating until 8 am. Additionally, there is a cave about halfway north of the road westward from Harviken where both a rabid rock troll and an ice troll can be found."}
