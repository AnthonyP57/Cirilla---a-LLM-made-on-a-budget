{"question": "Why might fire magic be considered differently from other practices labeled as Forbidden Arts or Dark Arts?", "answer": "Fire magic is sometimes counted among the Forbidden Arts but appears to be discouraged rather than outright forbidden. This distinction is highlighted by the fact that Klara Larissa de Winter, a mistress of Fire magic and the foundress of Aretuza, was considered a respectable mage."}
