{"question": "How does Geralt acquire the pimpernel for Gremist's task in 'Practicum in Advanced Alchemy'?", "answer": "Geralt needs to find the Morskogen Forest and search for a pimpernel using his Witcher Senses. If he has not already collected it earlier, he will encounter a druid who explains that many young druids have been sent to collect pimpernel but failed. Geralt then follows Ramund's tracks through white wolves, down a path split going up and down the hill. Heading downhill, they find an armored arachas near a neat pile of stones with Jorre the White\u2019s dead body underneath. If the succubus is not killed, she will lead Geralt to her lair where he can take a pimpernel. However, if the succubus is killed, Geralt must follow her scent to her lair and take one of the pimpernel flowers there."}
