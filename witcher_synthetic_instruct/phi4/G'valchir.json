{"question": "What are the two ways G'valchir can be acquired in The Witcher game?", "answer": "G'valchir can be obtained by receiving it from a dentist as a reward for completing the 'Won't Hurt a Bit' quest, or as a possible reward from the Royal huntsman after killing all ten trophy monsters in Chapter V. Alternatively, it can be acquired by completing the Mud and Velvet quest and keeping the money instead of returning it, which requires killing Captain Jean-Pierre."}
