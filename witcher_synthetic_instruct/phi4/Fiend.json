{"question": "What is a fiend's primary method of incapacitating its prey in The Witcher 3, and how can it be countered?", "answer": "A fiend's primary method of incapacitating its prey is through hypnosis using its third eye located in the center of its forehead. This causes victims to become entranced, seeing only the glowing eye before their death. To counter this, witchers can use signs like Axii to break the charge-up of the hypnosis or employ bombs such as Samum to permanently disable the fiend's third eye and prevent any use of hypnosis."}
