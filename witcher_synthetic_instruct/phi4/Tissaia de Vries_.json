{"question": "What significant role did Tissaia de Vries play during the Thanedd coup, and what was her ultimate fate?", "answer": "During the Thanedd coup, Tissaia de Vries broke Garstang's magical barriers to allow Nilfgaardian traitors held in dimeritium shackles to fight back. As the battle intensified, she became emotional and fought against Redanian soldiers with lightning and fire to protect them from attacking Garstang. She then teleported Triss Merigold and a heavily wounded Geralt to safety. Ultimately, Tissaia committed suicide by slitting her wrists, an act that marked the end of the Council and paved the way for the establishment of the Lodge of Sorceresses."}
