{"question": "What is the function of the Mutagenerator in The Witcher: Blood and Wine expansion, and how does it relate to mutations?", "answer": "The Mutagenerator is a quest item given to Geralt by Regis as a token of appreciation. It stores life essence from dead beings killed by its wearer and can transmute this energy into a random greater mutagen once sufficiently charged with 100 kills. This makes the Mutagenerator useful for the mutation procedure discovered by Professor Moreau, which Geralt applies."}
