{"question": "What were the key factors that led to the fall of Stygga Castle and the demise of the early School of the Cat witchers?", "answer": "The fall of Stygga Castle and the demise of the early School of the Cat witchers were primarily due to a few critical events. First, Gezras and his group attacked their creators after freeing fellow students who had been subjected to failed mutation experiments that enhanced rather than dulled their emotions. This internal conflict weakened the school's stability. Later, royal armies planned an assault on Stygga Castle; they infiltrated it with assistance from Gezras' group. The castle was besieged for three days, resulting in the death of every defending witcher."}
