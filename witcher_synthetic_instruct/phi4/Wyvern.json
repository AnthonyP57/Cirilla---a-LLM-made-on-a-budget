{"question": "What are the key differences between wyverns and dragons as described in 'The Witcher'?", "answer": "Wyverns differ from dragons primarily because they do not breathe fire, nor do they lay waste to entire villages. While wyverns hunt sheep, they are not interested in abducting local virgins, unlike what is commonly expected of dragons. Wyverns are also smaller than dragons."}
