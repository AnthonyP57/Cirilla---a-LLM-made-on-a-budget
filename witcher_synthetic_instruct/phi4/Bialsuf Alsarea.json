{"question": "What event led to the fall of the School of the Manticore, and what were its consequences?", "answer": "The fall of the School of the Manticore occurred during an event known as the Day of Fire in 1146. A titanic fire elemental appeared from the Fiery Mountains, targeting a royal caravan organized by the Queen of Zerrikania to arrange a diplomatic marriage for her son. Despite mobilization, the witchers were unable to defend effectively due to lack of siege artillery and many were killed along with half of the royal family and a third of the Zerrikanian court. As a consequence, Zerrikania distanced itself from the remaining witchers, sought alternative sea routes to the west, and left the Manticores without support, leading to their decline."}
