{"question": "What was the strategic significance of Brenna in the aftermath of its battle according to Annales seu Cronicae Incliti Regni Temeriae?", "answer": "The strategic significance of Brenna in the aftermath of its battle was that it marked the beginning of the end for Nilfgaard's northern expansion. King Jan Natalis capitalized on the victory by quickly moving southward, destroying divisions of the Third Army meant to relieve Menno Coehoorn and causing the Centre Army Group to flee across the Yaruga River. This led to a series of further setbacks for Nilfgaard, including guerrilla warfare vexations in Verden and an uprising in response to their defeats, resulting in Duke de Wett's retreat to Cintra. Additionally, Brenna prompted the feuding kings Demavend and Henselt to unite against Nilfgaard, ultimately routing a numerically superior Nilfgaardian force at Aldersberg."}
