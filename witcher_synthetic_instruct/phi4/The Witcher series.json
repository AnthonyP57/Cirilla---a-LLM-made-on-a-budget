{"question": "What are the titles of the two short story collections by Andrzej Sapkowski that feature Geralt, and how are they connected?", "answer": "The two short story collections by Andrzej Sapkowski featuring Geralt are 'The Last Wish' (Ostatnie \u017cyczenie) and 'Sword of Destiny' (Miecz przeznaczenia). Sword of Destiny was published first but collects later stories than The Last Wish. The original collection titled Wied\u017amin, which included the earliest short stories, is now out of print and replaced by these two collections. All fifteen stories were eventually collected in these books."}
