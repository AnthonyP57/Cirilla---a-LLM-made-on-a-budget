{"question": "How does Triss Merigold use Alzur's shield to assist Geralt in The Witcher?", "answer": "Triss Merigold uses Alzur's shield to protect Geralt by casting it on him during two significant moments. First, she teleports him to the Salamandra base in Chapter III and shields him from harm. Secondly, if Geralt selects her as his guardian in a battle against the Grand Master's conjured minions on the Ice Plains, she casts Alzur's shield on him for protection."}
