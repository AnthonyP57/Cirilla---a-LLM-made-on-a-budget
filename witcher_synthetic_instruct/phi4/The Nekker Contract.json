{"question": "How does Geralt plan to exterminate the nekkers according to his observations and actions in the Nekker Contract?", "answer": "Geralt plans to exterminate the nekkers by destroying their access to the surface. He learns from a book called 'Nekkers in the Mist' that the local nekkers use a system of underground tunnels to move around. Geralt decides that if he can find and destroy all entrances to these tunnels, most of the nekkers will be buried alive, making it easier to exterminate them. He carries out this plan by purchasing or crafting four grapeshot bombs, placing them in his quickslot, and using them to destroy the creatures' tunnel access points."}
