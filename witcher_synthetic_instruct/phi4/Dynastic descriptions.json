{"question": "What is the significance of Calanthe's cenotaph in Cintra, and why was it built by Emhyr var Emreis?", "answer": "The cenotaph for Queen Calanthe in Cintra holds symbolic importance as it serves as a tribute to her legacy despite her body being desecrated after the Battle of Marnadal. It is located in the royal crypt of Cintra's castle and was built on orders from Emhyr var Emreis, the Emperor of Nilfgaard, only one year following the city's capture by his forces. The decision to construct this cenotaph was initially met with resistance within Nilfgaard's military circles but ultimately enhanced the emperor\u2019s popularity among Cintra's conquered populace. This gesture likely aimed at legitimizing Nilfgaardian rule over Cintra and demonstrating a degree of respect for local customs and history, thereby fostering goodwill and potentially easing tensions between the conquerors and the conquered."}
