{"question": "What are some key characteristics and behaviors of devourers as described in 'The Witcher' series?", "answer": "Devourers, also known as Black Annis, resemble old, ugly women with witch-like viciousness. They feast on human flesh, preferring it fresh and warm, though they will eat carcasses as well. Devourers hunt in groups at night, often referred to by peasants as sabbaths. They are known for deceiving their victims and inflicting torture before consuming them. Contrary to popular myths, they do not fly on broomsticks or reside in gingerbread houses. In combat, using the Quen sign can protect against their attacks; a blizzard potion helps slow down enemies, making it easier to avoid hits. Devourers explode when their health is low, releasing damaging shockwaves. They are related to rotfiends and have appeared as both male and female in later games."}
