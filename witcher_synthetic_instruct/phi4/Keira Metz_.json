{"question": "What actions did Keira Metz take during the Thanedd coup, and how did her plan eventually unfold?", "answer": "During the Thanedd coup in early 1267, Keira Metz planned a coup with other Northern mages to prevent Nilfgaard supporters from taking control within the Brotherhood of Sorcerers. On June 30th, as part of this plan, she and her allies stayed awake while others slept to arrest the traitors at dawn. They managed to apprehend several traitors but were eventually overpowered in a battle at Garstang. Keira was thrown out of a window by Artaud Terranova; however, Geralt saved her from serious harm by catching her fall. Despite surviving with injuries and being exiled by her king, she sought refuge at Philippa's castle, where they attempted to help Queen Hedwig regain control of Redania."}
