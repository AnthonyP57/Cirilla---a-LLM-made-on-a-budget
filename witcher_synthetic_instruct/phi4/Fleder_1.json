{"question": "What makes fleders particularly dangerous when they attack?", "answer": "Fleders are particularly dangerous when they attack due to their method of catching prey by leaping from above. They fight with mindless rage using their teeth and claws, attempting to catch and tear apart any weaker beings. Additionally, as ekimmaras, they have the ability to regenerate, which makes them formidable opponents even for trained soldiers."}
