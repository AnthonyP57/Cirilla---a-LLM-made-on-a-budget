{"question": "What are the benefits and limitations of using Virga for a witcher?", "answer": "Virga increases a witcher's resistances to Poisoning, Incineration, and Bleeding, making him less vulnerable to monsters' special attacks, which is beneficial in fights against creatures that employ powerful special attacks such as those causing bleeding, being venomous, or breathing fire. However, it limits the ability to execute subtle attacks and makes the witcher more resistant to tactics he himself relies on, like Poisoning, Incineration, or oils that increase Bleeding. Additionally, Virga moderately increases Toxicity when consumed."}
