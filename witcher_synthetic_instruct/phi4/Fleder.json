{"question": "What are some characteristics that distinguish fleders from other vampires in 'The Witcher' series?", "answer": "Fleders, considered lesser vampires, have several distinguishing characteristics. They possess primitive instincts and bear a closer resemblance to animals than humans, with wide toothy jaws, flat faces, hairless bodies often covered in warts, and bat-like features including glowing red eyes and horn-like protrusions on their heads. Unlike typical vampires, they do not exhibit the stereotypical long black coats and black hair. Fleders primarily fight using their teeth and claws, attacking with mindless rage and attempting to catch prey by leaping from above. Despite being less intelligent than other vampires, fleders are still very dangerous due to their ability to regenerate as ekimmaras."}
