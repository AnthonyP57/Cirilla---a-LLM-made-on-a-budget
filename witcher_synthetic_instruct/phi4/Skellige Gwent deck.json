{"question": "What are the two unique features of the Skellige Gwent deck and how do they provide advantages?", "answer": "The Skellige Gwent deck has two unique features that provide potential advantages. The first feature involves Cerys, a hero with the swarm ability who can summon Shield-Maidens possessing Tight-Bond. If both 2+ Shield Maidens and Cerys are in the starting hand, Shield Maidens can be summoned early and then restored to the deck for use in subsequent rounds via the default leader card. The second feature revolves around Berserker units that transform into stronger versions with row-buffing/Tight-Bond abilities when triggered by Mardroeme cards. However, this feature relies significantly on luck."}
