{"question": "What are the possible romantic outcomes when choosing a present for Shani during 'A Midnight Clear' in The Witcher 3, and how do they differ?", "answer": "In 'A Midnight Clear', Geralt can choose from four gifts to give Shani: a rowan branch, chamomile, rowanberry brandy, or mead. If he gives her the rowan branch, she will put it in her hair, and this choice leads to a romantic ending with minor differences based on dialogue choices during their walk together. Choosing any of the plants (rowan branch or chamomile) results in a more romantic night that ends with Shani leaving after morning talks. If Geralt gives rowanberry brandy or mead, if they kiss near the large tree and proceed to sail out onto the lake for intimacy, she will vomit during climax if alcohol was chosen as the gift, adding humor to the scene. In contrast, giving a plant leads to a more romantic end without such an interruption."}
