{"question": "What is the role of alchemy in The Witcher's gameplay?", "answer": "Alchemy plays a major part in the gameplay of The Witcher. Players can create various potions that provide benefits such as increased health or endurance regeneration, night vision, and other effects. The recipes for these potions can be learned through scrolls or experimentation. Drinking unknown potions is risky because if the potion fails, it will poison Geralt. Additionally, alchemy allows players to create oils and bombs, which augment weapon damage or serve as combat weapons, respectively, though they require allocated talent points in the corresponding skills."}
