{"question": "What tactics can a witcher use to effectively combat water hags during rainstorms?", "answer": "Water hags are particularly dangerous during rainstorms as these conditions hinder the effectiveness of the Igni Sign. To combat them, a witcher should slow the water hag down with Yrden, allowing enough time to strike it with their silver sword once it bursts from the mud. Additionally, since water hags can throw balls of mud to blind opponents, witches must keep their eyes on the hag when attempting this maneuver to dodge in time. Using Dragon's Dream bombs combined with a shot of Igni might set them and drowners they work alongside on fire. Northern Wind bombs can freeze them, making them more vulnerable to physical attacks. The Axii Sign is also effective for stunning water hags, allowing multiple attacks."}
