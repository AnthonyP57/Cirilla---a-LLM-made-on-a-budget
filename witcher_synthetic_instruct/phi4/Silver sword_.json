{"question": "What are the materials and design features of a witcher's silver sword?", "answer": "A witcher's silver sword is traditionally made from meteoric iron, coated in silver, and inscribed with magical runes. Although purely silver would be too soft for practical use, making it ineffective as a weapon, the silver coating is essential for its effectiveness against supernatural enemies. Additionally, in gameplay, these swords often feature pinching crossguards that form a 'Y' shape with their grip, serving as a visual aid to distinguish them from steel swords."}
