{"question": "How do noonwraiths affect farmers working in fields during midday?", "answer": "Noonwraiths appear when the sun is at its highest in fields on windless days, signaled by swaying grains. They dance and lure farmers into joining them, after which no one leaves alive. Farmers therefore avoid working or stay in the shade during midday to escape these ghosts."}
