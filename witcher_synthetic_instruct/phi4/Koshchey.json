{"question": "How is a koshchy created and what makes it difficult to kill?", "answer": "A koshchy is created through rituals such as Alzur's Double Cross or Fregenal's Triangle Within a Triangle, which are vile rituals known to some sorcerers. It is extremely tough to kill because of its nearly immortal nature attributed to the magic ritual used in its creation, and it possesses features that make it formidable, including being half-arachnid and half crustacean with powerful forelegs."}
