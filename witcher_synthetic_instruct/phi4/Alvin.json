{"question": "What is speculated about Alvin's identity in relation to Jacques de Aldersberg?", "answer": "Many fans speculate that Alvin might actually be Jacques de Aldersberg, the Grandmaster. This theory arises from several observations: Alvin shares similar characteristics with Jacques, such as wearing a dimeritium pendant and showing visions of people dying. Additionally, the conversations in the Epilogue between Geralt and Jacques mirror advice given to Alvin earlier, suggesting they might be the same person. Furthermore, it was confirmed in 'The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt' that this theory is correct when a letter from 'A', believed to be Alvin, reveals he is Jacques de Aldersberg."}
