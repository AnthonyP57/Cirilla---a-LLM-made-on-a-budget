{"question": "What combat tactic does the Wicked Witch use to attack Geralt in the Blood and Wine expansion?", "answer": "The Wicked Witch uses her broom to become airborne and attempts to douse Geralt in poisonous soup from above, while keeping herself shielded by a protective magical bubble. When she descends to use her soup attack, the bubble recedes briefly, allowing for an opportunity to interrupt her using an Aard sign or a crossbow shot. Once grounded, it is advisable to destroy her broom before she summons additional creatures and becomes airborne again."}
