{"question": "What are the weaknesses of gargoyles in 'The Witcher' series, and how can a witcher exploit them?", "answer": "In 'The Witcher' series, gargoyles have several weaknesses that a witcher can exploit. They feel the sting of silver blades, making them vulnerable to weapons like Deithwen, which provide a 25% bonus against them. Dimeritium Bombs are also effective as they disrupt the magic spell giving them life. Additionally, while the Aard Sign is generally ineffective due to their stone composition and great mass, it can still be used to stun them, allowing a witcher to kill them without causing an explosion. The Yrden sign can slow them down, making evasion easier, and Quen provides protection against their powerful stomp attacks."}
