{"question": "What are some of the unique abilities and characteristics of the draug encountered in 'The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings', and how should Geralt approach fighting it?", "answer": "The draug is an arch-wraith with the ability to shake the earth beneath Geralt's feet, change its form into a fiery tornado, and summon ghastly archers and trebuchets. It cannot be parried in combat, and fast attacks do negligible damage against it. To effectively fight the draug, Geralt should use strong attacks and attack from behind to bypass its shield, as frontal attacks require breaking through the shield first."}
