{"question": "What physical characteristics distinguish water hags from other creatures?", "answer": "Water hags are distinguished by their nearly two yards tall, wrinkled and wart-covered bodies with skin the color of a long-dead cadaver. They have stinking hair like seaweed, bony growths on their backs that can be up to two spans long, and claws comparable in ferocity to those of a werewolf."}
