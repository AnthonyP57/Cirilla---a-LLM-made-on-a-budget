{"question": "What tactics should a witcher use to defeat a succubus, and what changes occurred after Patch 4.0 regarding their vulnerabilities?", "answer": "To defeat a succubus, a witcher must act quickly due to the creature's surprising brute strength and ability as a spell-slinger. A witcher might try to talk down a succubus with tales of seduction or use combat tactics such as exploding bolts, aard, or Northern Wind to disrupt their spell-weaving and pin them down for attacks. Relentlessness is key; they must prevent the succubus from controlling the battle. Prior to Patch 4.0, succubi were vulnerable to steel swords rather than silver ones, which posed challenges because hybrid oil could not be used against them, rendering perks like Protective Coating ineffective."}
