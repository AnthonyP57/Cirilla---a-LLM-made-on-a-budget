{"question": "What are some key characteristics and cultural aspects of the vodyanoy as described in 'The Witcher' lore?", "answer": "The vodyanoy, also known as fishpeople or fish-eyed creatures, are an intelligent race living in advanced underwater cities at the bottom of the Great Sea. They have developed a unique civilization distinct from land dwellers, known for their skills in metalworking and masonry. Vodyanoy culture includes worshiping multiple deities, with priests highly esteemed for their magical abilities believed to come from these deep-sea gods. Physically, vodyanoy are scaly humanoids with spherical bulging eyes, broad maws with conical teeth, and large combs on their heads. They have muscular legs suited for nimble movement even on land but primarily survive underwater using gills that dilate when exposed to air; they wear breathing masks to survive longer on the surface. In 'The Witcher', vodyanoy are depicted as having tense relations with humans, particularly in Murky Waters, and they play a role in mediating conflicts involving deities like the Lady of the Lake."}
