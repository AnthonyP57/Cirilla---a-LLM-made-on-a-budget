{"question": "What are some of the strategies players should consider when developing their Gwent deck, according to gameplay tips?", "answer": "Players should aim to win each round with as few cards as possible and develop decks that focus on high point-value unit cards. This approach helps in conserving stronger cards for later rounds. Additionally, maintaining a balanced mix of Close, Ranged, and Siege unit types is recommended since they can be influenced by certain Weather and special cards. Planning for the long game by ensuring you don't exhaust your deck prematurely is also crucial."}
