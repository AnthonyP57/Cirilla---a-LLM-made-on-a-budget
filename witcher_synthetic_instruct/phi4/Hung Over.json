{"question": "What are the ingredients needed to remove Geralt's tattoo in 'The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings', and where can they be found?", "answer": "The ingredients needed to remove Geralt's tattoo in 'The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings' are white myrtle petals, green mold, and wolf's aloe leaves. These items can be purchased from Anezka in Lobinden, Myron in the Kaedweni camp, or Marcus and The Incredible Lockhart in Loc Muinne. White myrtle is also commonly found growing in gardens and the wild, so it may not need to be bought."}
