{"question": "What happens if Geralt kills Reverend Nathaniel without questioning him first in the quest Carnal Sins?", "answer": "If Geralt kills Reverend Nathaniel without questioning him first, it is assumed that Geralt thought Nathaniel was the murderer. As a result, after the quest completes, additional clues can be found indicating Geralt was wrong: a woman's corpse with a letter taunting Geralt is located next to Triss' hideout, and Hubert leaves a confession note on a table in the morgue revealing the full story."}
