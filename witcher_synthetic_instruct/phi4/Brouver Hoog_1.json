{"question": "What actions did Brouver Hoog take in response to the elves' call for solidarity, and what were the long-term outcomes of those decisions?", "answer": "Brouver Hoog rejected the elves' call for solidarity by expelling their messenger from Mahakam and closing its gates. Over time, he waited as the elves suffered a total defeat, with their domains reduced to ruin and their youth dying in battles across the Continent. Brouver's decision allowed Mahakam to flourish independently during this period, though it was burdened by some measure of guilt for not aiding the elves."}
