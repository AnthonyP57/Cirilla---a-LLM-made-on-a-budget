{"question": "What are some methods Geralt can use to defeat Golyat in 'The Beast of Toussaint' quest, and what specific achievement or item does each method yield?", "answer": "Geralt has several strategies for defeating Golyat: shooting him with a crossbow directly in the eye results in an instant kill and awards the 'David and Golyat' achievement; engaging in regular combat is another option if preferred. After Golyat's death, he leaves behind a second corpse containing over 100 coins."}
