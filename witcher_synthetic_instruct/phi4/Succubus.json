{"question": "What is a succubus and how does it interact with humans according to the text?", "answer": "A succubus (female) or incubus (male) is considered a creature, sometimes seen as a demon, that resembles a highly attractive human being. It seduces real humans in dreams before appearing physically, targeting men who are of age. Succubi and incubi draw energy from their victims to sustain themselves, potentially leading to exhaustion or death. They do not have violent intentions but aim to satisfy an insatiable lust through sexual acts with other humanoid species they encounter. Although initially pleasurable for the 'victims', these advances can lead to madness or death."}
