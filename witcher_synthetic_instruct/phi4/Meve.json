{"question": "What were some of Queen Meve's personal attributes and how did these contribute to her reputation among the Northern rulers?", "answer": "Queen Meve was admired for her wisdom, cunning, and 'woman\u2019s intuition,' which made her an influential figure among the Northern rulers. Her ability to cut to the heart of matters during royal deliberations ensured that she commanded attention and respect when she spoke. Additionally, her rejection of infanticide at Hagge set her apart as a moral leader. Meve was also known for her physical prowess; despite nearing 40 by August 1267, she maintained an athletic build capable of climbing trees effortlessly, proficient in several melee weapons, and often fought alongside her soldiers. Her calm demeanor contrasted sharply with the emotional outbursts of rulers like Henselt, which amused her and further underscored her composed leadership style. These attributes contributed to Meve's reputation as a wise, cunning, and courageous leader during the Second War with Nilfgaard, earning her the epithet 'Sun Slayer' from bard Dandelion."}
