{"question": "What happened to Avallac'h when he was on his way back from the Isle of Mists, and how was it connected to Ciri?", "answer": "When Avallac'h was sailing back to Skellige after taking Ciri to the Isle of Mists, Eredin managed to curse him. As a result of this curse, which was slowly taking effect, Avallac'h put Ciri into a deep sleep-like state to hide her on the island and prevent her from being detected by the Wild Hunt. He then left the isle as he began transforming due to the curse."}
