{"question": "What steps must Geralt take to reach Professor Moreau's laboratory in 'Turn and Face the Strange'?", "answer": "Geralt first receives a letter directing him to find Professor Moreau\u2019s lab. He investigates Orl\u00e9murs Cemetery using his Witcher Senses to follow a trail of footprints left by a grave robber, which leads him to an underwater portal after using an old map of Toussaint. Entering the portal takes him to ruins where he navigates spike traps and defeats spectral panther statues. After more navigation through these ruins involving shooting blocks with his crossbow and choosing portals based on statue orientation, Geralt eventually reaches the laboratory."}
