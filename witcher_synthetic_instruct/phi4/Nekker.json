{"question": "What are the main tactics used by nekkers during an attack, and how can players counter these attacks effectively?", "answer": "Nekkers primarily use overwhelming numbers to attack their prey by striking en masse. They burrow from beneath the ground and swarm upon targets, trying to surround them quickly and cut off all escape routes. Despite being disorganized in their attacks due to a lack of courage, they can be challenging because of their agility and acrobatics. Players can counter nekker attacks effectively by using strong combat skills and techniques, such as employing bombs like Northern Wind or Dancing Star to thin out the swarm. The Aard sign is particularly useful for knocking multiple nekkers to their backs or over one another, making it easier to break through large groups. Additionally, the Whirlwind ability can be effective when combined with appropriate enchantments on a sword."}
