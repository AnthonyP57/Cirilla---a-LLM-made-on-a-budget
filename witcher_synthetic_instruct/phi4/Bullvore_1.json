{"question": "How should a witcher prepare for combat against a bullvore according to The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings?", "answer": "A witcher should use a strong style with heavy blows when fighting a bullvore, as the creature is slow but has tough skin and heals quickly. It is also advisable to coat a blade with Necrophage Oil because this aggravates the bullvore's wounds and provides an advantage, whereas common poisons or oils that increase bleeding are ineffective due to the bullvore's immunity."}
