{"question": "Why did Angoul\u00eame feel grateful towards Geralt?", "answer": "Angoul\u00eame felt grateful towards Geralt because he saved her life when she was captured by Governor Fulko Artevelde's men. They had the intention of killing her to extract information about plans to kill Geralt, but she revealed these plans instead. Upon learning this, Geralt negotiated for Angoul\u00eame to be handed over to him rather than being executed. As a result, she joined his company to repay her debt and help find Ciri."}
