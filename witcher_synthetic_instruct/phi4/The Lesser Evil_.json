{"question": "What does Stregobor use to conceal his true identity when he occupies Master Irion's tower?", "answer": "Stregobor conceals his true identity by creating an illusion, making himself appear as if he is surrounded by a garden of Eden, complete with a naked, young woman casually picking apples. He chooses the name 'Master Irion' because it seemed fitting to take on that name while occupying Irion's tower."}
