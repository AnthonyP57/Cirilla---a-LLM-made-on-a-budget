{"question": "What are some reasons why necromancy is considered forbidden, despite arguments supporting its potential advantages?", "answer": "Necromancy is considered forbidden because, although proponents argue that reviving corpses can uncover secrets or reutilize soldiers in battle without wasting lives of the living, it has been observed that the revived dead are always unpredictable and their revival leads to entirely negative side effects. These outcomes invariably result in evil consequences regardless of the noble intentions behind using necromancy. This suggests a divine prohibition against transgressing natural laws."}
