{"question": "What tactics should be used when fighting an ekimma, considering its abilities and weaknesses?", "answer": "When fighting an ekimma, it is crucial to use a silver sword due to their susceptibility. Since they can regenerate health over time, attempts to tire them out or wait for them to bleed to death are ineffective; instead, focus on defeating them quickly. Utilizing Black Blood potions can weaken them as the blood from wounds inflicted by their claws can harm and momentarily knock them back, providing a brief respite. Additionally, employing Moon Dust bombs can prevent ekimmaras from teleporting, making it easier to land attacks."}
