{"question": "What is a notable characteristic of golden dragons' ability to change form compared to their offspring?", "answer": "Golden dragons like Villentretenmerth have the innate ability to take on any form, whereas their offspring are generally more limited in this ability. For example, Villentretenmerth's daughter, Saesenthessis, can only take on a human form because her mother is a non-golden dragon."}
