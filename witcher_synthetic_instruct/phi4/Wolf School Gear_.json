{"question": "What are some key features and differences between the various tiers of Wolf School Gear available in The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt?", "answer": "The Wolf School Gear includes different tiers such as Wolven, Enhanced Wolven, Superior Wolven, Mastercrafted Wolven, Grandmaster Wolven, Legendary Wolven, Enhanced Legendary Wolven, Superior Legendary Wolven, Mastercrafted Legendary Wolven, and Grandmaster Legendary Wolven gear. Each tier offers upgraded versions of basic items like armor, swords, gauntlets, boots, and trousers. Notably, the mastercrafted Wolf sets are downloadable content, while grandmaster equipment from the Blood and Wine expansion does not require these mastercrafted versions to be crafted. Unlike other witcher school sets, legendary versions of Wolven equipment have distinct global item IDs, making them available through console commands or mods outside New Game +."}
