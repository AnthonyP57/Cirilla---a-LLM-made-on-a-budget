{"question": "What are the key differences between an Ifrit and a Fire Elemental according to 'The Witcher' series?", "answer": "Ifrits and Fire Elementals differ mainly in their nature and abilities. An Ifrit is a minor genie of fire, serving mages who can command it to be obedient through understanding the element of fire, while Fire Elementals are large golems fueled by fire with no connection to genies. Unlike Ifrits, which do not fulfill wishes but serve as aides in research about fire for worthy summoners, Fire Elementals are combat-focused entities that use their physical strength and magical attacks like throwing fireballs and charging at opponents."}
