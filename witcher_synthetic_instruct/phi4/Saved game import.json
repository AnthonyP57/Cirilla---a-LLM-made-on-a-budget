{"question": "What are some of the choices and items transferred from The Witcher to The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings, and how can these be affected by game settings?", "answer": "In The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings, several choices, items, and a small amount of money are transferred from The Witcher. Transferred items include steel swords (Ard'aenye, D'yaebl, G'valchir, Gwalhir), silver swords (Aerondight, Moon Blade), and Raven's armor. Additionally, about 1% of the orens saved in The Witcher is added to the standard ~150 orens of a fresh game start. Some key choices transferred are whether Geralt killed or spared characters such as Thaler during All the King's Men, Romance with Shani, Princess Adda during Her Highness the Striga, and Siegfried (Neutral/Scoia'tael paths only). If the saved games from The Witcher aren't detected by the game due to language settings, creating a new save file in English during specific game portions can resolve this issue."}
