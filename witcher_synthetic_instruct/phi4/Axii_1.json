{"question": "What are some mechanics and limitations associated with using the Axii sign in 'The Witcher' series?", "answer": "In 'The Witcher' series, the Axii sign is used by witchers like Geralt to calm or manipulate people and creatures. It can cause enemies to fight alongside the caster temporarily but wears off over time or when they take damage from the user. The effectiveness of Axii depends on Geralt's endurance level; if it's too low, he cannot cast the sign. Some opponents are immune to Axii (e.g., Archespores and Drowners), while others like Zeugls are susceptible. To use Axii, the player right-clicks on a target. Additionally, in 'The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt', the charm can also be used during dialogues with NPCs for more information or benefits."}
