{"question": "What are the consequences of revealing or keeping Vivienne's secret from Guillaume during the quest?", "answer": "If Geralt chooses to reveal Vivienne's secret about her curse to Guillaume, several key events unfold: \n\n1. **Transfer of Curse**: With Guillaume's help, a ritual is performed that successfully transfers the curse from Vivienne to him. Despite initial doubts, this leads to Guillaume carrying the burden of the curse, which appears weakened in its effects on him.\n\n2. **Romantic Outcome**: Geralt encounters the happy couple later in Toussaint, where they are seen together and appear deeply in love. This outcome aligns with the narrative theme that even challenging circumstances can lead to fulfilling relationships.\n\n3. **Narrative Confirmation**: The successful curse transfer and subsequent happiness of Vivienne and Guillaume serve as a confirmation of the unique atmosphere of love and hope prevalent in Toussaint, reinforcing the fairy-tale-like setting of the region.\n\nIf Geralt chooses to keep Vivienne's secret from Guillaume:\n\n1. **Secret Ritual**: The curse is reversed using an oriole egg without involving Guillaume. This ritual shortens Vivienne\u2019s life significantly but grants her freedom from the curse during her remaining years.\n\n2. **Vivienne\u2019s Journey and Fate**: Vivienne, free of the curse, travels extensively, sharing stories of Geralt's assistance with her newfound freedom. She eventually dies in Skellige after a predetermined number of years.\n\n3. **Guillaume's Fate**: Without knowledge of the secret and without taking on the curse himself, Guillaume becomes a drunkard. His body is later found by Geralt during 'The Night of Long Fangs' quest, if this path was chosen, providing closure to his storyline."}
