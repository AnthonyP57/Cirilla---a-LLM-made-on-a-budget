{"question": "What are the possible outcomes for Geralt when he participates in a horse race in The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, and what determines these outcomes?", "answer": "When Geralt participates in a horse race in The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, there are two main outcomes. If Geralt wins the race, he receives an amount of crowns that is double the bet he placed with the bookmaker. However, if he loses the race, the amount he bet will be lost. Additionally, the outcome of the associated quest or quest objective may also be affected; losing a race can cause the related quest to fail."}
