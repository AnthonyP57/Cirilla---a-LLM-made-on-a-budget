{"question": "What are the consequences of the White Frost as described in 'The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt', and how can it potentially be halted?", "answer": "The White Frost results in the freezing of entire planets, leading to unending snowfall and eventually causing all settlement sustaining activities to cease. Survivors' supplies dwindle until exhaustion, followed by death. After the defeat of the Wild Hunt, Avallac'h and Ciri try to halt the White Frost by heading to a tower on Undvik. Ciri, being the last vessel of Elder Blood, confronts the White Frost through a portal. Her survival depends on whether Geralt has shown that he cherishes her, trusts her judgment, and encourages her confidence."}
