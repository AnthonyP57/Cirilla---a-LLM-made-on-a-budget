{"question": "How do the different castes of endregas function within their colonies, and what is their primary survival strategy?", "answer": "Endregas are divided into castes: warriors, guards, and queens. Warriors are the most numerous and primarily focus on defense. Guards are less common and likely serve as protectors for the queens. Queens are rare and remain hidden but fiercely defend the nest when threatened. Their primary survival strategy involves laying eggs in cocoons hung from trees within nests, which lesser creatures guard zealously. To exterminate an endrega colony effectively, one must destroy these cocoons to lure out and defeat the queen."}
