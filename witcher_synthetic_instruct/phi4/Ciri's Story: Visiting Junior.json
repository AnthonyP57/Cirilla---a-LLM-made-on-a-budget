{"question": "What new skill does Ciri gain during her mission in 'Visiting Junior,' and how is it used?", "answer": "Ciri gains a new skill called 'Blink' during the mission. This skill allows her to attack multiple foes from behind, similar to how Geralt uses alternate modes for his signs. It's activated by holding down the key that casts signs and releasing when ready. Although useful against foes with shields, it has a flaw where Ciri returns to her original position after using it, which can be risky if an enemy was about to strike during its activation."}
