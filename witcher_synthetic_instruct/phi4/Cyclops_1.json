{"question": "What are some unique characteristics of cyclopses as described in The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt?", "answer": "Cyclopses can be identified by their single eye located on their foreheads, although sometimes other signs like their enormous size and strength might give them away. They have a seething hatred for all humans and are known to live incredibly long lives, with one well-preserved specimen documented as being over three hundred years old at the time of its death."}
