{"question": "What were some of the consequences for Nazairians after their rebellion against the Nilfgaardian Empire?", "answer": "After the rebellion against the Nilfgaardian Empire, the Nazairians faced several harsh consequences. They were forbidden to carry swords and thus often resorted to using elven messers, which are technically large knives rather than swords.
