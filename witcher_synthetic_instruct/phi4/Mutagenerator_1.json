{"question": "What is the process required to generate a random greater mutagen using the Mutagenerator in The Witcher: Blood and Wine expansion?", "answer": "To generate a random greater mutagen, you need to accumulate 100 kills with the Mutagenerator equipped. Once it reaches this charge level, indicated by the icon glowing blue, you must manually go into your inventory and use the Mutagenerator to transmute the stored life essence into a greater mutagen.
