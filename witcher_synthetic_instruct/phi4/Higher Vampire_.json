{"question": "What are some characteristics that distinguish higher vampires from their lesser counterparts?", "answer": "Higher vampires differ from their lesser counterparts in several ways: they look exactly like human beings and can evade detection by a witcher's medallion, do not need to drink blood to survive although they enjoy it, have advanced intelligence and unique abilities such as transformation into a giant bat, invisibility, and mesmerizing gaze. They are also invulnerable to sunlight, fire, silver, and possess incredible regenerative powers allowing them to heal from severe injuries over years or decades."}
