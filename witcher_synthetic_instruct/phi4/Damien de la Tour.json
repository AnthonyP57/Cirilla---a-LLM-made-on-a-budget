{"question": "How did Captain Damien de la Tour's perception of Geralt change over time?", "answer": "Initially, Captain Damien de la Tour viewed Geralt with suspicion and saw him as a rival due to his arrival at the Beauclair court. However, after fighting side by side with Geralt against the Beast's attacks, Damien began to see Geralt as an altogether decent fellow who wished only to help Toussaint. This change in perception led them to become friends in their gruff, manly way."}
