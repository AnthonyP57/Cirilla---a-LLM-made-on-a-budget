{"question": "What are some methods to weaken or counteract the Hounds of the Wild Hunt during combat?", "answer": "The hounds can be momentarily weakened by using Axii, but only for a brief moment. They are also vulnerable to fire-based attacks, as their icy nature makes them susceptible to the Igni Sign. Additionally, Yrden can slow multiple hounds if they get too close, allowing you to break away from their attack. When dealing with large groups of hounds, using a Dragon's Dream bomb in conjunction with igniting it with Igni can significantly wound them."}
