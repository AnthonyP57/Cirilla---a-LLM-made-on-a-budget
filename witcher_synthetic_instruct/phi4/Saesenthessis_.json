{"question": "What are the key differences between Saesenthessis's abilities as a dragon and her capabilities when fighting in human form?", "answer": "As a crossbred dragon, Saesenthessis has several formidable abilities: she can fly with agility inherited from her green dragon mother, absorb magical energy, breathe fire, and use her massive weight to destroy buildings using her fangs, claws, and tail. Her shapeshifting ability, a trait from her golden dragon father, allows her to transform between human form and dragon form.\n\nIn contrast, when Saesenthessis fights in human form, she relies on physical combat skills rather than innate draconic powers. She wears full body armor and wields a longsword along with a heater shield for defense and offense. Her human abilities are complemented by unique skills that leverage her dragon heritage: \n\n1. **Shieldstrike** - A short charge culminating in a shield bash that stuns enemies, creating a flaming trail to deal damage over time.\n2. **By Sword and Fire** - A skillshot ability where she smashes the ground with fire, dealing radial flame damage and leaving a path of burning flames for additional damage over time.\n3. **Dragon Soul** - An area attack that causes her to explode in eight waves of fiery energy emanating from her position, again leveraging her passive ability 'Hidden Dragon' which enhances regeneration when within flames."}
