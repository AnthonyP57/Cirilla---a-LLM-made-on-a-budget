{"question": "What precautions should be taken when killing a rotfiend to avoid self-inflicted harm?", "answer": "When killing a rotfiend, one must take care to survive the moment of its death because the monster's corpse releases explosive fumes that can ignite with a mere spark. It is recommended to draw the dying rotfiend away from its kin and ensure it doesn't explode near other rotfiends or in tight spaces to prevent chain reactions."}
