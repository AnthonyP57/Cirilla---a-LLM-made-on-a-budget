{"question": "What makes fiends particularly dangerous to hunters, and how can a witcher increase their chances of success against them?", "answer": "Fiends are extremely dangerous due to their immense size, strength, and the ability to heal quickly from injuries. They use a third eye for hypnosis which can incapacitate victims by drawing them into a hypnotic state where they see only the glowing eye before death. To increase chances of success, witchers can use bombs such as Samum or Devil's Puffball, which exploit the fiends' fear of loud noises and can disable their third eye permanently. Additionally, using relict oil on blades enhances effectiveness against fiends. Drinking Enhanced Cat or Superior Cat potions grants immunity to hypnosis attacks."}
