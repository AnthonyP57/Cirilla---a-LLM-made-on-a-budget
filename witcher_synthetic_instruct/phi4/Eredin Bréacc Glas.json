{"question": "What was Eredin Br\u00e9acc Glas's ultimate goal and how did his approach to leadership change after he became the King of the Wild Hunt?", "answer": "Eredin Br\u00e9acc Glas's ultimate goal was to open a gate between worlds, allowing the Aen Elle (elves) to seize control of the Continent and escape their doomed world. His approach to leadership changed significantly after he became the King of the Wild Hunt; initially serving as a cavalry commander under King Auberon Muircetach, Eredin exhibited strength and determination that eventually led him to assassinate his ruler in order to claim power for himself. As king, he leveraged human legends and superstitions by having his riders wear ghostly armor and haunting waters with a ship resembling Naglfar to instill fear without the need for violence, relying on psychological warfare to maintain control."}
