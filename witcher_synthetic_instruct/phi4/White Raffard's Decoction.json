{"question": "What is the effect of consuming White Raffard's Decoction in The Witcher series, and how can it be mitigated?", "answer": "Consuming White Raffard's Decoction immediately restores a majority of Vitality lost through combat. However, it is highly toxic, which adversely affects coordination and reduces the damage dealt by the witcher for a short time. This side effect can be alleviated by drinking the Swallow or Rook potion simultaneously."}
