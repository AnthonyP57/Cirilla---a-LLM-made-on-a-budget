{"question": "Who led a group of witcher drifters that eventually formed an alliance with the Zerrikanian crown, and what did they promise in return for building castles?", "answer": "A group of witcher drifters was led by Iwan when they encountered stragglers fleeing from the site of a ruined caravan. They protected the survivors, which included members of the Zerrikanian Queen's Court. Impressed by their exploits, the queen proposed an alliance where Iwan and his brothers would work exclusively for the Zerrikanian crown to guard merchant caravans and emissaries in exchange for building two great castles on either side of the Korath Desert."}
