{"question": "What does Geralt discover about the supposed nekker attack in Fyresdal, and what leads him to a cave?", "answer": "Geralt discovers that the supposed nekker attack on Uggo, son of Olaf in Fyresdal is suspicious. Upon examining a destroyed wagon site northeast of the village, he finds inconsistencies, such as the state of the horse and corpse, suggesting something odd. A cutscene then shows Geralt narrowly avoiding being crushed by a boulder, prompting him to investigate further up a hill where he sees tracks made by the boulder leading into a cave."}
