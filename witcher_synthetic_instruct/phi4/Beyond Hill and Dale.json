{"question": "What are the steps Geralt must take to find and collect the three magic beans in The Land of a Thousand Fables?", "answer": "Geralt begins by following the yellow brick road to find Syanna after entering The Land of a Thousand Fables. He defeats the Wicked Witch and learns about the necessity of finding three magical beans from Syanna, who explains that they are needed to grow a stalk leading to an exit. Geralt then talks to Joss, who provides convoluted clues for locating each bean: Joss says the red bean 'had not been swallowed' by the wolf, the blue bean is 'out in the open' guarded by nobody times three, and the yellow bean can be found 'deep underground'. To obtain the beans, Geralt must first act out Little Red Riding Hood to retrieve the red bean from a wolf. He then climbs Longlocks\u2019 tower to get the yellow bean after defeating her wraith. Finally, he destroys the brick house of the Three Little Pigs using Aard to obtain the blue bean."}
