{"question": "How does Geralt's age and appearance evolve across various adaptations and media, considering both canonical sources and speculative interpretations?", "answer": "Geralt's age and appearance have varied significantly across different adaptations and media. In Andrzej Sapkowski\u2019s original novels, Geralt was initially portrayed as being over 50 years old, although the exact age wasn\u2019t specified until Rozdro\u017ce kruk\u00f3w (2024) established his birth year as 1211, making him 38 years younger than Yennefer. This revelation aligns with Sapkowski's earlier statements about witchers aging more slowly and preferring to hide their true ages due to societal biases against older individuals.\n\nHowever, adaptations produced before Rozdro\u017ce kruk\u00f3w often depicted Geralt much older. For instance, Wied\u017amin: Gra Wyobra\u017ani set his birth a year earlier than Yennefer\u2019s (1174), making him older in that timeline. The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt suggests he is nearly a century old around the game's events in 1272. Netflix\u2019s adaptation further diverges by placing Geralt\u2019s birth in 1160, making him significantly older than his literary counterpart.\n\nGeralt's appearance also varies considerably across media. Early promotional artwork for The Witcher 2 and other adaptations often used different models compared to the final in-game versions. In response to public feedback, CD Projekt RED chose to retain Geralt\u2019s original face from The Witcher despite initial plans to update it, demonstrating how external perceptions can influence creative decisions.\n\nIn summary, while canonical texts provide a consistent timeline for Geralt's age and aging process unique to witchers, adaptations have taken liberties resulting in discrepancies. These variations reflect differing artistic interpretations and narrative needs across various formats."}
