{"question": "How did Angoul\u00eame end up joining Geralt's company?", "answer": "Angoul\u00eame joined Geralt's company after he saved her life. Initially, she formed a gang with other orphans and later joined the Nightingale gang. When Governor Fulko Artevelde's men captured her while trying to extract information about plans to kill Geralt, Geralt intervened on the condition that Angoul\u00eame be handed over to him instead of being executed. Grateful for his intervention, she felt obligated to repay her debt and thus joined his company to help find Ciri."}
