{"question": "What are the effects of consuming Petri's Philter, and why is it recommended for certain types of witchers?", "answer": "Consuming Petri's Philter significantly increases the intensity of all witcher Signs, enhancing the impact of Aard, boosting the defenses of Quen, improving the effectiveness of Yrden, among other effects. However, it markedly increases Toxicity, making it unsuitable for use with any other potions due to its high toxicity. It is recommended for witchers who rely more on magic than on their swords and are preparing to fight monsters vulnerable to Signs."}
