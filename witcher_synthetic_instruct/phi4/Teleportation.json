{"question": "What are some potential dangers associated with teleportation as described in the text?", "answer": "Teleportation is considered risky because the travel occurs through a strange realm where time, heat, light, and matter do not exist. Creatures from the material plane that get trapped there may become scarred or insane if they remain too long. If someone gets lost during teleportation, it can be extremely difficult to bring them back. Additionally, in 'Wied\u017amin: Gra Wyobra\u017ani,' using a teleportation spell has a dangerous cost."}
