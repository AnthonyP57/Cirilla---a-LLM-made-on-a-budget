{"question": "What happened when Rience tried to use magic against Ciri and her group on the frozen lake near Mil Trachta?", "answer": "Rience, scared out of his wits, cast a spell intending to crack the ice towards the sound of Ciri's skates. Instead, it cut the ice horizontally right where their group was standing. Rience fell into the freezing water but clung to the edges. Ciri then approached him and, in a last-ditch effort, he offered to reveal Yennefer's location if she saved him. However, Ciri mocked him by expertly skating on the edge of the ice crack and slicing through his fingers with her skates, severing them. Rience eventually drowned too late to hear Vilgefortz's message."}
