{"question": "What are the two ways Geralt can start the 'Peace Disturbed' quest in The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt?", "answer": "Geralt can start the 'Peace Disturbed' quest by either talking to two women outside a cave southeast of Kaer Trolde Harbor, which requires him to face all the monsters within the crypt, or by finding and entering through a hidden entrance in the crypt, where he will only encounter the main monster."}
