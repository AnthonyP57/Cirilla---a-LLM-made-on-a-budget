{"question": "Where can Geralt find the Mysterious Merchant in Chapter II if he follows Iorveth's path, and what happens if you fight him with your bare hands?", "answer": "In Chapter II, following Iorveth's path, Geralt can find the Mysterious Merchant leaning against a wall just north of The Cauldron in Vergen. If Geralt fights him with his bare hands by putting his swords back into his inventory and striking him, the merchant can be knocked down with a single punch. However, after recovering, he will start a fistfight again and continue attacking whenever Geralt comes near him."}
