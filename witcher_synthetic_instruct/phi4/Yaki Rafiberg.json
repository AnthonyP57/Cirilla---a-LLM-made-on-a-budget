{"question": "What is Yaki Rafiberg's stance on gwent, and how does it manifest during Count Martin Monnier's tournament?", "answer": "Yaki Rafiberg is a dwarf and an avid gwent purist who protests against the introduction of the Skellige deck at Count Martin Monnier's tournament. He shows up with other purists to protest outside the Pheasantry in Beauclair. Yaki's commitment to traditional gwent manifests when he agrees to play Geralt, using his Scoia'tael deck, to test the new faction's worth if Geralt reaches the final match."}
