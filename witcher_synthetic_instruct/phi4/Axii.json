{"question": "How does Geralt use the Axii sign in 'The Witcher' series, and what are some limitations or requirements when casting it?", "answer": "In 'The Witcher' series, Geralt uses the Axii sign to calm down people and creatures, manipulate their minds, or hex enemies, causing them to fight alongside him. The effect wears off over time or can be broken if they take damage from Geralt. In combat, it can lessen the number of hostile creatures or humanoids he faces by making them allies temporarily. To cast Axii, right-click on a target, and it uses up some endurance. If Geralt's endurance level is too low, he cannot cast the sign. Additionally, certain opponents have immunity to Axii, while others are more susceptible."}
