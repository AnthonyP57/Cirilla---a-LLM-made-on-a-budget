{"question": "What are some of the key features and abilities that make a koshchy a formidable foe in combat?", "answer": "A koshchy is extremely tough to kill due to its nearly immortal nature, which results from magic rituals like Alzur's Double Cross or Fregenal's Triangle Within a Triangle. It has arthropod-like features, being half-arachnid and half crustacean with powerful forelegs that can instill terror in those afraid of spiders. Additionally, it moves surprisingly fast for its size and is known to cause massive destruction."}
