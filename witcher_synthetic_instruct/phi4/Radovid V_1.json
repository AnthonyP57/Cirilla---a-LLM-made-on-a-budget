{"question": "How did King Radovid's early experiences influence his reign?", "answer": "King Radovid V of Redania, known for his ruthless and calculating nature as 'the Stern', was deeply influenced by traumatic events in his youth. His father, King Vizimir III, was assassinated when Radovid was just eight years old, an event that marked the beginning of a challenging childhood under the regency led by Queen Hedwig and the Regency Council. It is during this period that he encountered Philippa Eilhart, who became his tutor and is rumored to have profoundly shaped him into the hardened ruler he later became. These early experiences forged in him a deep-seated mistrust of mages and adversaries alike, which would manifest in his aggressive policies towards them throughout his reign."}
