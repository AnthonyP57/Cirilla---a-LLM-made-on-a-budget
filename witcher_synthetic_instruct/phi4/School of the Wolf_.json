After the 1260s, Vesemir became the only living member of the 'old' (pre-pogrom) witchers from the school. He spent winters at Kaer Morhen and welcomed some witchers from other schools like Co\u00ebn, but banned Cats and Vipers. Following his death, Eskel took responsibility for watching over Kaer Morhen."}
