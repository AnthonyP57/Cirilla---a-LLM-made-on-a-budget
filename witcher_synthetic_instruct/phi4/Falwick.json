{"question": "What role did Count Falwick play in the Order of the White Rose and how did his interactions with Geralt evolve?", "answer": "Count Falwick was a noble member of the Order of the White Rose serving under Duke Hereward. He took an early interest in swordsmanship, joined the order, and was knighted. Falwick trained the arrogant young knight Arthur Tailles and later tasked him to convince Geralt of Rivia to leave the duchy by Hereward's orders. Despite his hatred for the witcher, Falwick remained calm during confrontations with Geralt and Nenneke. In Ellander, he orchestrated a duel between Geralt and Tailles. In The Hexer TV series, Falwick became Geralt's nemesis, working as a Nilfgaardian spy to find Ciri and was ultimately killed by Geralt."}
