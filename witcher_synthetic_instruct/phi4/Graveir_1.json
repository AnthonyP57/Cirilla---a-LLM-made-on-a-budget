{"question": "Why do graveirs have a particular fondness for marrow, and how does this preference influence their behavior during feeding?", "answer": "Graveirs have a particular fondness for marrow because it is considered their greatest delicacy. This strong preference influences their behavior during feeding as they become very attentive to potential threats or intruders, like witchers, who might interrupt their meal. The graveir's heightened attentiveness can lead them to extend an invitation, albeit in a hostile manner, allowing the witcher to join what would be considered a 'meal.'"}
