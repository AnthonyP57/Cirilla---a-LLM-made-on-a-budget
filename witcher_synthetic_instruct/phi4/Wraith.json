{"question": "What is the recommended method to ensure a wraith never returns after it has been dealt with, according to the 'Journal Bestiary entry'?", "answer": "To ensure a wraith never returns, first find its body and dig up the corpse. The corpse will not be rotten but will have blood on its lips. Pierce the corpse with an aspen stake, cut off the head, place it between the corpse's legs, and then set the entire corpse on fire."}
