{"question": "What are the four types of archespores catalogued in 'The Witcher' and how do they differ?", "answer": "Four types of archesporus have been catalogued: brown, green, purple, and yellow. They differ primarily by color, with brown being the least dangerous, while green and purple are the most dangerous. The yellow archespore, allegedly cultivated by mages from Ban Ard, has a strength similar to its green-colored cousins."}
