{"question": "Who was responsible for Adda's curse and what were the consequences?", "answer": "A jealous courtier named Ostrit, who was in love with Adda's mother, was responsible for casting a curse on Adda as a result of his unrequited feelings. This curse caused Adda to be born a striga, leading her to terrorize Vizima until Geralt lifted the curse. However, even after being freed from the striga form, Adda suffered intellectual impairment and remained vulnerable to relapses."}
