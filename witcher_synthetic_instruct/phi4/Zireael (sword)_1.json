{"question": "What are some of the unique features and history associated with Ciri's Zireael sword in The Witcher series?", "answer": "Zireael, also known as Jask\u00f3\u0142ka or Swallow, is a gwyhyr (a rare type of blade made by gnomes) crafted from dark iron. Its blade resembles a flame and features engraved floral decorations with a tower topped by a swallow. The sword was originally given to Ciri by Esterhazy in Fano after she had been captured by Leo Bonhart, who forced her to fight using this weapon under the effects of Fisstech in Claremont arena. Ironically, Ciri later used Zireael to kill Bonhart at Stygga Castle. In The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, 'Zireael' refers to two weapons that Ciri uses: a steel sword named after the original gnomish blade and a silver sword given to her in one of the game endings if the Witcher ending is achieved."}
