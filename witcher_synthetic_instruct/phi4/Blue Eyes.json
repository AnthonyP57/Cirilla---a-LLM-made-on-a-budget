{"question": "What is the main conflict Geralt faces in the quest 'Blue Eyes'?", "answer": "Geralt faces a dilemma where he must decide whether to believe that Blue Eyes, Patrick de Weyze's sister who works at a brothel, is being controlled by a vampire and should be saved from such influence, or if she is there of her own free will, choosing to become a vampire. This decision involves potentially siding with either the vampiresses controlling the brothel or Patrick de Weyze."}
