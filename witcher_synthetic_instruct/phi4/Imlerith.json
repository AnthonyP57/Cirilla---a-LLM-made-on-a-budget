{"question": "What tactics does Geralt use to defeat Imlerith during their battle?", "answer": "Geralt uses several tactics to defeat Imlerith. Initially, when Imlerith fights with his massive mace and shield, Geralt dodges directly past him at the start of Imlerith's attack combo to get behind him. He then lands two quick hits on Imlerith's back; if a third hit is attempted, it gets parried by Imlerith's shield swipe. After this, Geralt rolls past Imlerith again during his shield swing to land another two hits. Using bombs like Samum can also be effective against him. Once Imlerith drops the shield and uses the mace two-handed while teleporting around, Geralt waits for Imlerith's winded moments after several attack combos to land multiple hits. During these winded phases, Geralt continues this cycle of dodging and attacking until he finally defeats Imlerith by force-feeding him a devastating Igni blast through his helmet grill and then caving in his head."}
