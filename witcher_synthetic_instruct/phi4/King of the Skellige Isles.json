{"question": "How is the position of monarch in Skellige determined?", "answer": "The position of monarch in Skellige is not hereditary; instead, the king or queen is elected by the jarls of the influential clans. The candidates must prove their worthiness through tasks or missions to demonstrate they are fit for the throne. After a potential ruler passes these tests and is selected by the jarls, they are crowned under the hallowed tree Gedyneith in Ard Skellig."}
