{"question": "What are the primary senses that Shaelmaars rely on for navigation, and how do humans typically fight them in combat?", "answer": "Shaelmaars are completely blind and rely on echolocation to navigate their environment. Humans typically try to fight Shaelmaars by creating loud noises or vibrations with heavy objects to lure the creature towards obstacles, causing it to injure itself upon impact. Additionally, witchers may use tactics like using Aard Sign or Samum bombs to cause a shaelmaar to slam into something, or dodge its rolling charge and attack its vulnerable underbelly."}
