{"question": "How does Geralt ultimately deal with the djinn during his quest with Yennefer in 'The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt'?", "answer": "Geralt and Yennefer work together to capture and subdue the djinn. Once they have it pinned down, Yennefer convinces the djinn to dispel a previous spell that had bound Geralt and Yennefer's fates together. This involves both strategy in capturing the creature and negotiation with the djinn once it realizes its situation is hopeless."}
