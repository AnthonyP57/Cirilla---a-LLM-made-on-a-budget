{"question": "How did the training methods and characteristics of the School of the Cat differ from other witcher schools?", "answer": "The School of the Cat focused on developing fighting styles that emphasized speed, precision, and agility. Their training included honing balance by walking a tightrope blindfolded, with the difficulty increasing over time. Unlike other witchers who aimed for neutrality, Cat witches were known to take on contracts as spies and assassins, often showing favor towards elves and working closely with them. The mutations used in their school also led to enhanced emotions instead of suppression, contributing to a reputation for cruelty and impetuousness."}
