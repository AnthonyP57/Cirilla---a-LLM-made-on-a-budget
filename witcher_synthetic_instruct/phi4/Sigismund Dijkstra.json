{"question": "What was the outcome of Geralt's involvement with Sigismund Dijkstra and the assassination plot against King Radovid?", "answer": "The outcome depends on how Geralt chooses to handle the situation. If Geralt completes the quest 'Reason of State' and intervenes, he stops Dijkstra from killing his allies Thaler and Vernon after they successfully assassinate King Radovid. This intervention results in Dijkstra's death as a consequence of underestimating Geralt's resolve for neutrality. Conversely, if Geralt does not intervene when Dijkstra attempts to kill his allies, Dijkstra succeeds in eliminating them and secures a stronger position, fortifying himself against Nilfgaard."}
