{"question": "What are the types of locations Geralt needs to clear in the 'Knight for Hire' quest, and what are some characteristics or challenges associated with each type?", "answer": "In the 'Knight for Hire' quest, Geralt needs to clear a total of 15 Undiscovered locations. These include four main types: Persons in Distress, Knight Errants in Distress, Abandoned Sites, and Hanse Bases. Each type presents different challenges:\n\n1. **Persons in Distress**: These are standard rescue missions where Geralt helps individuals being attacked by bandits.\n2. **Knight Errant in Distress**: Similar to Persons in Distress but involves a knight fighting bandits who is capable of handling the situation independently, reducing the likelihood of death even if Geralt does not intervene directly.\n3. **Abandoned Sites**: These locations are infested with creatures such as spriggans, wraiths, cyclopses, giant centipedes, and werewolves that need to be cleared out. The NPCs do not inhabit these sites after clearing them.\n4. **Hanse Bases**: More challenging than Abandoned Sites, Hanse Bases are defended by a band of formidable bandits. Geralt must defeat the leader and prevent a weak bandit from lighting a signal fire that calls for reinforcements. Successfully clearing a Hanse Base results in allied NPCs inhabiting it."}
