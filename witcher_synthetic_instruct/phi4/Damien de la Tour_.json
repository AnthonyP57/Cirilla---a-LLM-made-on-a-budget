{"question": "What was Captain Damien de la Tour's initial reaction to Geralt, and how did it change after their battle against the Beast?", "answer": "Captain Damien de la Tour initially reacted to Geralt with suspicion and saw him as a rival. However, after they fought side by side against the Beast's attacks, Damien realized that Geralt was an altogether decent fellow who only wished to help Toussaint. This change in perception led them to become friends in their gruff, manly way."}
