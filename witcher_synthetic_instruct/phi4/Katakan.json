{"question": "What are some unique traits and abilities of katakans that differentiate them from other vampire species in the Northern Kingdoms?", "answer": "Katakans have several unique traits and abilities that set them apart from other vampire species. Unlike alps, bruxae, mulas, and Higher Vampires, they are susceptible to sunlight which slows their regeneration significantly at midday. They share common vampire traits such as invisibility to magical scanning and a preference for drinking blood without mutilating victims. However, katakans possess bat-like features, long claws that continuously grow, and an ability to disguise themselves as humans. In combat, they are notably smarter and more powerful than ekimmaras, with increased power at night. They can become invisible, necessitating tactics such as using the Yrden sign or Igni to detect them. Additionally, their invulnerability to steel requires specific strategies like immobilizing them with Yrden before attacking with silver."}
