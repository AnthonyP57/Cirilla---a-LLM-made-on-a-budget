{"question": "How can a player ensure their saved game from The Witcher is detected when starting The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings if it initially isn't recognized?", "answer": "If the game is unable to detect your saves from The Witcher despite them being in the appropriate folder, you should create a new save file in either the Ice Plains or the Order of the Flaming Rose Cloister areas using English language settings. This will help resolve detection issues related to language settings."}
