{"question": "What are the ingredients required to brew the Swallow potion in The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt's quest 'On Death's Bed', and where can they be found or obtained?", "answer": "To brew the Swallow potion for the quest 'On Death's Bed' in The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, you need the following ingredients:\n\n1. Dwarven spirit - This can be purchased from the tavern keeper in White Orchard, crafted by Geralt if he doesn't want to buy it, or found in a lootable sack in the western-most corner of the alchemist's garden.\n2. Drowner brain - This ingredient can be obtained by looting drowners that are killed along the river coast, particularly between White Orchard and the Nilfgaardian Garrison or near the Ransacked Village.\n3. Celandine - Tomira sells celandine, but it also grows in fields surrounding White Orchard, especially between the village center and the herbalist's house. Alternatively, if you keep the contents of a locked chest from the quest 'Precious Cargo', you can obtain celandine that way."}
