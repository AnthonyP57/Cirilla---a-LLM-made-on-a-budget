{"question": "What distinguishes an alghoul from a normal ghoul in terms of intelligence and behavior?", "answer": "Alghouls are distinguished from normal ghouls by their larger size, strength, colorings, and most importantly, their higher intelligence. Unlike ghouls that are primitive creatures unfit to plan even simple ambushes, alghouls are capable of forethought and thus pose a much more dangerous threat. They lead packs of other ghouls due to their wits, making them the greatest threat in a ghoul pack. Once an alghoul is dealt with, it renders the rest of the pack less coordinated."}
