{"question": "What must Geralt do to defeat the King of the Wild Hunt during the quest, without using mandrake root?", "answer": "Geralt can defeat the King of the Wild Hunt by placing Dragon's Dream bombs in the location where the King will spawn before starting the quest or before nightfall. He needs nearly 60 bombs for this approach. Geralt must first pull away and kill the initial wave of wraiths from the circle, causing the King to appear with a second wave. By positioning himself correctly, using Igni with boosted sign intensity, he can launch a long-range fireball at the King, which will trigger the bombs if hit accurately."}
