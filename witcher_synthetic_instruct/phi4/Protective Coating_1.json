{"question": "What is the effect of combining Protective Coating with high-tier armor sets like Cat School Gear in The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt?", "answer": "Combining Protective Coating with high-tier armor sets like Cat School Gear, which can provide +75% resistance to a damage type such as elemental, results in resistance stacking up to 100%. While the damage will not be reduced completely to zero, it becomes so minimal that it can be almost ignored even on Death March difficulty."}
