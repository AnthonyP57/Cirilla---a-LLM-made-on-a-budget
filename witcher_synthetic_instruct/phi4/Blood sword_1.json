{"question": "What conditions must be met for players to obtain the Blood Sword in the game, and what are its accessibility differences between Xbox and PC versions?", "answer": "Players can obtain the Blood Sword if they side with Iorveth at the end of Chapter I and get it before entering the cave with Saskia on the Xbox version. If siding with Roche, players must acquire it during Hatred Symbolized while meeting up with Saskia and Zoltan. On PC versions, players cannot access the sword if following Iorveth's path because that part of the Tunnel of the Founders is inaccessible."}
