{"question": "What happens if Geralt sides with the she-troll against Adam Pangratt's mercenaries?", "answer": "If Geralt sides with the she-troll, he speaks to the mercenaries explaining that he needs her alive. The mercenaries refuse to let her go, so Geralt fights alongside the she-troll, defeating them and sending the survivors to Vergen to surrender to the rebels. She then thanks Geralt for his help, and he persuades her to return to her husband."}
