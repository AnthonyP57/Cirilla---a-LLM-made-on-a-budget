{"question": "How does Geralt find and kill the monster in the sewers during 'The Beast,' and what are some optional tasks he can do afterwards?", "answer": "In 'The Beast' quest, Geralt begins by checking the notice board outside Seven Cats Inn to learn about a contract from Olgierd von Everec regarding a dangerous monster in Oxenfurt's sewers. Geralt visits Olgierd and heads into the sewers where he uses his Witcher Senses to locate the area where the monster attacked Shani and Redanian soldiers. He finds a key using his senses, which unlocks the lower level of the sewers leading to the monster's lair. In the lair, Geralt encounters and ultimately kills the monstrous creature, revealing it to be an enchanted prince once defeated.\n\nOptional tasks include: \n1. After defeating the monster and encountering Gaunter O'Dimm during a shipwreck cutscene, Geralt can choose to fight Ofieri warriors that appear on the beach (optional reward of 200). \n2. Later, he meets Master Mirror at midnight at the crossroads beneath the willows for further instructions from Olgierd von Everec.\n\nThroughout this quest, players can find various notes and items such as a Prescription in Shani's Clinic post-quest or a Letter from an Ofieri merchant on a mercenary\u2019s body. Additionally, while under Gaunter's mark, Geralt gains unique dialogue options with characters like Ciri, Triss, and Yennefer."}
