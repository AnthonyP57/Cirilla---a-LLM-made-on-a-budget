{"question": "What are the key differences in outcomes based on Geralt's decisions regarding the botchling during the 'Family Matters' quest in The Witcher 3: Blood and Wine expansion?", "answer": "In the 'Family Matters' quest of The Witcher 2, Geralt faces a critical decision involving a cursed creature known as a botchling. This choice leads to two distinct outcomes:\n\n1. **Lubberkin Option:**\n   - If Geralt decides to turn the botchling into a lubberkin through an ancient ritual, he completes the naming ceremony before the botchling can transform into its more monstrous form.\n   - Following tradition, the botchling is buried under the threshold of a building. Over time, it is reborn as a friendly household guardian known as a lubberkin.\n   - The lubberkin then leads Geralt to further clues about the Baron's missing wife and daughter, aiding in his search.\n\n2. **Botchling Killed:**\n   - If Geralt chooses to kill the botchling instead of performing the ritual, he collects its blood for use in an ancient rite.\n   - This action does not result in a lubberkin but is intended to provide Geralt with additional information about the fate of the Baron's wife and daughter through another form of magical intervention.\n\nBoth choices significantly impact the narrative progression and how Geralt uncovers further details about the disappearances."}
