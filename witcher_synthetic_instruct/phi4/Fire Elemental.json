{"question": "What is the primary weakness of a fire elemental in combat, and how can it be effectively countered?", "answer": "The primary weakness of a fire elemental is its vulnerability to silver blades; however, getting within sword's reach is dangerous due to their furnace-like heat. It is more effective to fight from a distance using frost-spewing and dimeritium bombs, which cause the most damage."}
