{"question": "What are the potential outcomes when Geralt reaches the exit of Albertus Cavern with Hugo?", "answer": "When Geralt reaches the exit of Albertus Cavern with Hugo, there are two main outcomes. If Geralt agrees to kill Lucien and Auguste, he will have to fight them (though they don't actually die), and Hugo will thank him. If Geralt refuses to fight, it turns out the thugs are just hunters, and the brothers decide to reconcile."}
