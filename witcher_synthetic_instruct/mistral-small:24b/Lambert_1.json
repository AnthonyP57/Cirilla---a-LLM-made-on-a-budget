{"question": "What was Lambert's final test to become a witcher?", "answer": "Lambert's final test was the Trial of the Medallion. He was accompanied by a group of young recruits. Together they sailed across the pond which ended in one drowning to death. They navigated through the caverns when they ran into a cyclops named Old Speartip who slew several of them including Voltehre. After climbing Troll's Head, they encountered a trio of rock trolls whom they managed to avoid. Upon reaching the Circle of Elements, Lambert retrieved his Witcher Medallion and proved himself worthy to set out on The Path."}
