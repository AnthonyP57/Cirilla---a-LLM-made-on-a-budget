{"question": "What is the best way to fight an Ekimma?", "answer": "To effectively combat an Ekimma, it's crucial to use a silver sword and aim to cut them down as quickly as possible. Avoid trying to tire them out or wait for them to bleed to death due to their regenerative abilities. Additionally, using Black Blood potions can weaken them, and Moon Dust bombs can prevent them from teleporting. If you are wounded by their claws, the blood can harm the Ekimma and give you a brief respite."}
