{"question": "How does the 'Invigoration' runeword interact with Geralt's health regeneration?", "answer": "The 'Invigoration' runeword works well with high health regeneration, as a higher rate of health regeneration during combat increases the speed at which the damage boost builds up. It also pairs effectively with Gourmet and water hag decoction, providing nearly constant health regeneration as long as Geralt remains at full health."}
