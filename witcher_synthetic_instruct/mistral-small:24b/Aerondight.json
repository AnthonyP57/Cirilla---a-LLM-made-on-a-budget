{"question": "What is Aerondight and what makes it special?", "answer": "Aerondight is a silver sword used for fighting monsters. It's relatively ineffective against humans but has unique properties that make it valuable. In 'The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,' it can gain up to three slots for runes, allowing its strength to grow with use. When fully charged and used to kill an enemy, its damage increases permanently."}
