{"question": "How can a witcher effectively counter a fiend's hypnosis attack?", "answer": "A witcher can counter a fiend's hypnosis attack by using signs to interrupt it, or by moving behind or to the side of the fiend so that they are not in view of the third eye. Additionally, a well-timed Samum bomb can permanently disable the fiend's third eye and prevent any use of hypnosis."}
