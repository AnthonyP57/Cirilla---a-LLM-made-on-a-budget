{"question": "What was Lambert's final test to become a witcher?", "answer": "Lambert's final test was the Trial of the Medallion. He was accompanied by a group of young recruits and they sailed across a pond, navigated through caverns where they encountered a cyclops named Old Speartip, climbed Troll's Head, and avoided rock trolls. Upon reaching the Circle of Elements, Lambert retrieved his Witcher Medallion and proved himself worthy to set out on The Path."}
