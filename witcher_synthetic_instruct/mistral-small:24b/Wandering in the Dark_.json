{"question": "What is the significance of the swallow symbol in the quest 'Wandering in the Dark'?", "answer": "The swallow symbol is significant because it is the name of Ciri's sword, Zireael, which means 'Swallow' in Elder Speech. Geralt uses his knowledge of this to figure out that they need to follow images of a swallow left by the elven mage as clues to find Ciri."}
