{"question": "What are the different outcomes if you bring Syanna to Tesham Mutna?", "answer": "If you bring Syanna, Dettlaff will try to kill her. If she has the ribbon from the Little Flint Girl, she'll be teleported away to safety and Dettlaff will force you to fight him. If she doesn't have the ribbon, she'll die and you can choose to fight Dettlaff or let him go."}
