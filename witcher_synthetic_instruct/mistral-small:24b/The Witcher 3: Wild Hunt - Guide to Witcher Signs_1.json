{"question": "What are the benefits of using the Quen sign in combat?", "answer": "The Quen sign provides a protective shield that absorbs damage, allowing Geralt to take hits without losing health. It is particularly useful against enemies with big, slow attacks and can be recharged quickly if using light armor. The alternate mode, Active Shield, creates a forcefield that restores health when hit by enemies, making it ideal for long endurance fights."}
