{"question": "What happens to the levels of monsters and quests in New Game +?", "answer": "In New Game +, the suggested difficulty levels for quests are scaled up by at least 25 levels, as are the levels of the monsters encountered. The scaling is live, meaning whatever level you were at when you completed the game and created a save file to start New Game +, the monster and quest levels will be scaled accordingly."}
