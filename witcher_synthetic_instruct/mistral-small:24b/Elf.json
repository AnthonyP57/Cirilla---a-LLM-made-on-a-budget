{"question": "What are some of the key differences between elves and humans according to the text?", "answer": "Elves live much longer than humans and are usually very attractive. They are capable of interbreeding with humans and dryads, but only young elves are fertile, so elven populations reproduce at a slower rate than humans. Elves believe they were created, unlike humans who evolved."}
