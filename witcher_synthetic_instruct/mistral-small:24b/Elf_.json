{"question": "What is the significance of the Scoia'tael guerrillas in elven history?", "answer": "The Scoia'tael guerrillas were formed by elves who faced racial prejudice and joined forces with dwarves. They gained a reputation as violent killers, and many elves who didn't join still aided their cause by providing shelter and food. This led to several pogroms throughout the kingdoms, resulting in the death of thousands of nonhumans, including elves."}
