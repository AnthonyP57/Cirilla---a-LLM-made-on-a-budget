{"question": "What is the most effective strategy for dealing with a Kikimore Queen in the game?", "answer": "The most effective strategy is to run away from the Queen and use the Aard sign to collapse the passage and destroy the supports of the Salamandra Cave, causing the section to fall on top of the Kikimore and kill it. Experienced players might also use Brown Oil, Quen, and Aard signs or bombs like Devil's Puffball and Dragon's Dream."}
