{"question": "What are some tactics to combat water hags?", "answer": "To combat water hags, you can slow them down with Yrden just as they burst from the ground. You can also use Dragon's Dream bombs combined with Igni or Northern Wind bombs to freeze them and make them more susceptible to physical harm. Axii can be used to stun them, allowing for multiple attacks."}
