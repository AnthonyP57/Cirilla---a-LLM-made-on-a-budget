{"question": "What are the primary effects of the Quen sign?", "answer": "The Quen sign forms a protective field around the witcher that absorbs a limited amount of damage, effectively shielding Geralt from one hit against most equal-level foes. It can be used multiple times in a fight if using Light Armor due to swift Stamina regeneration. The alternate mode, Active Shield, creates a visible forcefield around Geralt for as long as the Sign key is held down or until Stamina runs out."}
