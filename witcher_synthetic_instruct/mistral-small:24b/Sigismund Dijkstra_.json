{"question": "What is the character of Sigismund Dijkstra like?", "answer": "Sigismund Dijkstra, often referred to simply as Dijkstra, is a master spy and head of special forces for the kingdom of Redania. He is known for his razor-sharp intellect, great ambition, and shrewdness. Despite his imposing physical appearance\u2014being extremely tall, balding, and big-boned\u2014he is far from the stereotypical spy. Dijkstra is known to be deceptive in appearance, often giving off a sleepy and sluggish impression but possessing an exceptionally keen mind. He has a preference for bright-colored clothing and does not wear hoods. Dijkstra's life story involves significant political intrigue, betrayal, and survival. He was forced to flee Redania after falling out of favor with King Radovid and sought refuge in far-off lands before returning to Novigrad, where he became one of the leading figures in the criminal underworld under the alias Sigi Reuven."}
