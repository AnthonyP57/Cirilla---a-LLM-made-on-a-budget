{"question": "What is the best deal you can get for Hattori during the negotiation with Tinboy?", "answer": "The best deal you can get for Hattori is to negotiate (or by calling him crazy) then refuse to agree to a deal. When you reach the time reaction where Tinboy proceeds to leave, still choose 'no deal' and Tinboy will come back, agreeing to 25% and a discount at the store."}
