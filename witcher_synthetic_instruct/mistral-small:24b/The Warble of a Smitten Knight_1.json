{"question": "What are the consequences if you choose to keep Vivienne's secret from Guillaume?", "answer": "If you choose to keep Vivienne's secret from Guillaume, a few interesting things happen later: After the main story completes, you can meet Vivienne again in Novigrad, where she'll talk briefly of her travels so far and gives Geralt a wearable feather. Vivienne eventually goes to Skellige and can be observed around Kaer Trolde Harbor. After 7 years have passed, she will in fact die. Guillaume becomes a drunk and you can meet him again as well, though just for a passive conversation. He'll be in front of The Pheasantry."}
