{"question": "What are some of the limitations of a witcher medallion?", "answer": "Witcher medallions have several limitations. They cannot detect certain monsters like dopplers and higher vampires. Additionally, very strong magical auras, such as those found in Places of Power or during solstices, can cause aberrant reactions. In large cities with widespread use of simple magical amulets or sorcerous alarm systems, the medallion may also behave abnormally."}
