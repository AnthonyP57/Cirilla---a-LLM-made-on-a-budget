{"question": "What are drowners and where can they be found?", "answer": "Drowners, also known as muire d'yaeblen or vodniks, are creatures that inhabit bodies of water such as rivers, lakes, mill ponds, and city sewers. They are often mistaken for drowned men but are actually post-Conjunction relics. Drowners can be found in various locations including the outskirts of Vizima, by fishing villages, Old Mill, Vizima sewers, dike, swamp, Lakeside on Black Tern Island, Naiad's bathing spot near a village, and swamp cemetery."}
