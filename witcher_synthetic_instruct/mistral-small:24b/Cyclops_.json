{"question": "What are some effective combat tactics against a cyclops?", "answer": "To effectively fight a cyclops, it's important to move around and avoid standing in one place. Rolling to the side or behind the cyclops can help evade their attacks and reach their vulnerable flanks. If a cyclops raises both hands in the air, stay clear of its front as it will perform a ground-pound attack. At longer ranges, be cautious of their leaps and wild rushes. Using signs like Axii to confuse them or Quen for protection can also be helpful."}
