{"question": "What are some effective strategies for fighting a cyclops?", "answer": "To fight a cyclops, it's important to roll to the side or behind them to evade their attacks and reach their vulnerable flanks. Avoid standing in one place as they rarely flinch from witcher attacks. If a cyclops raises both hands in the air, stay clear of the front to avoid being flattened by its ground-pound. At longer ranges, be cautious of their leaps and wild rushes. Axii can temporarily confuse them, while Yrden helps with sword range combat. Quen is likely the best choice for handling these monsters."}
