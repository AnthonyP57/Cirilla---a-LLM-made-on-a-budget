{"question": "What are the possible outcomes for Malena based on Geralt's actions?", "answer": "The possible outcomes for Malena depend on Geralt's decisions. If Geralt does not interfere, Malena is arrested and charged with being an accessory to murder. If Geralt defends her but tells the truth about the corpses, she is still arrested. If he lies to save her, she betrays him but escapes. If he lies and then kills her or brings her to Loredo's men, she faces severe consequences including death."}
