He is a demonic pact-maker who grants wishes in exchange for evil deeds. O'Dimm has the ability to manipulate time and space, appearing suddenly and disappearing just as quickly. He often takes on various disguises, such as a beggar or an aristocrat, to blend into his surroundings. His initials form an acronym: G.O.D., which is a nod to his divine-like powers and influence. O'Dimm's character is inspired by several literary figures, including Randall Flagg from Stephen King's The Dark Tower series and Leland Gaunt from Needful Things."}
