{"question": "How can Geralt obtain the G'valchir sword in The Witcher?", "answer": "Geralt can obtain the G'valchir sword by completing the 'Won't Hurt a Bit' quest and receiving it as a reward from the dentist, or by killing all ten trophy monsters in Chapter V and getting it from the Royal huntsman. It can also be obtained by completing the 'Mud and Velvet' quest and keeping the money for yourself (which requires killing Captain Jean-Pierre), or found on the Fields in Chapter IV in the original version of the game."}
