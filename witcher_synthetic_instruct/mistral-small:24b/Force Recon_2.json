{"question": "What happens if Geralt chooses to side with Siegfried in the 'Force Recon' quest?", "answer": "If Geralt chooses to side with Siegfried, four Order scouts will join him for the mission and he will be ready for a fight at the Golem burial ground. However, if he hasn't delivered Golan Vivaldi's response to Yaevinn first, the quest 'Worth its Weight in Gold' will fail."}
