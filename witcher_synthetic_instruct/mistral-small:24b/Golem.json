{"question": "What is a golem and how are they typically defeated?", "answer": "A golem is a mindless matter brought to life by a spell. They obey their creator's orders without question and have boundless strength, ability to withstand pain, endless patience, and do not need food or drink. Defeating a golem is extraordinarily difficult as it does not bleed, feels no fear or mercy, and is invulnerable to fire and poison. Their only weakness is acid."}
