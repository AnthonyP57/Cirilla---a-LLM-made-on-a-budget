{"question": "How do I defeat the djinn in the 'Last Wish' quest?", "answer": "If enemy upscaling is on, this can turn into a tough, if not impossible, fight. If having difficulties with it on, turn it off prior to the fight (before the djinn spawns). With the correct gear and skills, such as using Bear School Gear and activating Quen, you should be able to defeat the djinn."}
