{"question": "What are the rewards for defeating Moa, the Royal Wyvern?", "answer": "Moa is a much more difficult battle to win. The best strategy is to carefully pull the Royal Wyverns away from Wyvern Island, by hugging the edge. Make sure only one is following you, and take them out one by one. Usually Moa will be accompanied by regular wyverns. If you get low on health and keep dying, make sure you have a swallow and/or be sure to use Quen to recover."}
