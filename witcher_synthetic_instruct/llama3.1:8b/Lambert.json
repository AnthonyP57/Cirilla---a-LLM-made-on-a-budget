{"question": "Why did Lambert feel bitter about his life as a witcher?", "answer": "Lambert felt bitter because, when he was a child, his father continually beat him and his mother. A witcher saved his father's life, but demanded payment by invoking the Law of Surprise, which resulted in Lambert being given to the witcher to be trained."}
