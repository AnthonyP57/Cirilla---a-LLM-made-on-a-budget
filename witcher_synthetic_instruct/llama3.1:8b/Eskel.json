{"question": "What is Eskel's appearance and personality like?", "answer": "Eskel has a menacing, metallic voice and a long, hideous, semi-circular scar running from the corner of his mouth across the length of his cheek up to the ear. He resembles Geralt of Rivia, but with more magical power emanating from his hands. Eskel is calm, patient, stable, thoughtful, and polite, but can appear disinterested when disagreeing with someone. He enjoys drinking and laughing with friends."}
