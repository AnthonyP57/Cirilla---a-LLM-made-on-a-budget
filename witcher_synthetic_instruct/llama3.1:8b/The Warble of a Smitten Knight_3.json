{"question": "What are some of the interesting things that happen later if you choose to keep Vivienne's secret from Guillaume?", "answer": "After completing the main story, you can meet Vivienne again in Novigrad, where she'll talk briefly of her travels so far and gives Geralt a wearable feather. She eventually goes to Skellige and can be observed around Kaer Trolde Harbor. After 7 years have passed, she will indeed die. Guillaume becomes a drunk and you can meet him again as well, though just for a passive conversation. He'll be in front of The Pheasantry."}
