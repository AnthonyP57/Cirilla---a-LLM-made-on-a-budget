{"question": "What are nekkers, and how do they behave in groups?", "answer": "Nekkers are social creatures that live in groups, often led by chieftains. They attack en masse, burrowing from beneath the ground to swarm their prey. Individual nekkers are weak, but large groups can overwhelm even veteran witchers."}
