{"question": "What are some tips for leveling up Aerondight?", "answer": "When leveling Aerondight, note that it requires 10 charges to reach full power. Each time a fast attack lands on an enemy, the charge count increases by one, and each strong attack lands on an enemy increases the charge count by two. Killing an enemy with 10 accumulated charges will expend all charges in a small golden flash, permanently increasing the weapon's damage by 2."}
