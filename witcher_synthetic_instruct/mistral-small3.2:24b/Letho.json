{"question": "What is the significance of Letho of Gulet in *The Witcher* series?", "answer": "Letho of Gulet, also known as the Kingslayer, is a renegade witcher from the School of the Viper who plays a pivotal role in *The Witcher* series. His actions, driven by his allegiance to the Nilfgaardian Empire, involve orchestrating the assassinations of Nordling kings\u2014including Foltest and Henselt\u2014to destabilize the Northern Realms. This manipulation serves Nilfgaard\u2019s broader war strategy, as it undermines the political and magical alliances that previously opposed the empire. Letho\u2019s complex relationship with Geralt of Rivia spans betrayal, confrontation, and reluctant cooperation, particularly in *The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt*, where Geralt chooses whether to aid him against his pursuers or abandon him. Letho\u2019s fate and contributions highlight themes of loyalty, redemption, and the consequences of war."}
