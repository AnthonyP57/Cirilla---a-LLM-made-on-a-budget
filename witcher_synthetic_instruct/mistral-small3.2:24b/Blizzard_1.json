{"question": "How does the Blizzard potion affect Geralt's movement and combat abilities in The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt?", "answer": "The Blizzard potion improves Geralt's reflexes and reaction time, allowing him to better parry and evade attacks. It slows down time, making Geralt's movement and everything else slower, which is particularly helpful against fast-moving enemies or those that teleport, such as wraiths and various types of vampires."}
