{"question": "What is the name of the quest in the Polish version and what does it mean?", "answer": "The quest is called \"Hulaj Dusza!\" in the Polish version, which is an idiom that cannot be translated literally. The closest English equivalent would be \"Party Animal.\" However, the Polish version is more fitting as it literally means \"Partying Soul,\" referring to the spirit or \"soul\" that is doing the partying."}
