{"question": "What is the main reason elves were defeated by humans?", "answer": "Elves were defeated by humans due to their slower reproduction rate. Elves can only conceive children during their youngest years, and even then, only one out of every two or three couples will successfully bear a child. This made it difficult for them to match the human population growth, leading to their ultimate defeat."}
