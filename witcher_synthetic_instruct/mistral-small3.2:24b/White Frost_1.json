{"question": "What is the significance of the White Frost in the context of the Conjunction of the Spheres?", "answer": "The White Frost is significant because it cannot be prevented, not even by mages, Aen Saevherne, or Ciri. The only salvation is to open the Ard Gaeth portals by Elder Blood so that people of the Continent could move to another world. After the defeat of the Wild Hunt, another Conjunction of the Spheres begins, and Ciri, being the last vessel of the Elder blood, heads through a portal to confront the White Frost."}
