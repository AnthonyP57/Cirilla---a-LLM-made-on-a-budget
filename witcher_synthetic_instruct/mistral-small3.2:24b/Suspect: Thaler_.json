{"question": "What is the 'Grand Truth' in the context of the Suspect: Thaler quest?", "answer": "The 'Grand Truth' is a critical knowledge that deems every suspect's innocence. It can be learned in three ways: in the cemetery crypt during the quest A Gravedigger's Gratitude, at the autopsy in the quest Anatomy of a Crime, or by clearing 5 of the suspects, which must include Ramsmeat, Thaler, Vincent Meis, and Golan Vivaldi."}
