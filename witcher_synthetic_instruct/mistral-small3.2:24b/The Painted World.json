{"question": "What is the Painted World and how did it come into existence?", "answer": "The Painted World is an otherworldly location that originally only existed in Iris von Everec's mind when she was alive. It was made up of blurred memories that she wished to forget. After she died, the world gained more substance, making her fears grow out of proportion with the original memories."}
