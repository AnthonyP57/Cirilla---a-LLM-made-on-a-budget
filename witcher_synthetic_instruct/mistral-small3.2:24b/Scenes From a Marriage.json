{"question": "What is the significance of the violet rose in the quest 'A Fleeting Nightmare' in The Witcher 3?", "answer": "The violet rose is a key symbol in the quest 'A Fleeting Nightmare.' It represents Olgierd von Everec's last gift to his wife, Iris von Everec, before he left her. The rose has withered in the real world, but it still exists in the painted world of Iris' imagination. Geralt's task is to retrieve the rose, but doing so comes with a moral dilemma: taking the rose will free Iris from her tormented existence, but it will also end her spirit's existence. If Geralt chooses to leave the rose, Iris remains in her slumber, and the dog and cat continue to watch over her. The rose thus symbolizes the lingering love and regret between Olgierd and Iris, as well as the cost of fulfilling Olgierd's wishes."}
