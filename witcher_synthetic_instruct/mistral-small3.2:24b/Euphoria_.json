{"question": "How does the Euphoria mutation interact with the Acquired Tolerance skill?", "answer": "The Euphoria mutation works extraordinarily well with Acquired Tolerance, as it not only increases the toxicity pool but also can be inserted into the additional slots provided by the mutation. At maximum, Acquired Tolerance can increase the toxicity pool to 267 (184 in Patch 4.0), which brings the limit of damage and sign intensity increase up to 200.25% (138% in Patch 4.0)."}
