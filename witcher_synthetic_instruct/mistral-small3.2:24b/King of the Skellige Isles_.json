{"question": "What happens if Geralt chooses not to interfere in the succession of the Skellige throne?", "answer": "If Geralt chooses not to interfere, Svanrige an Tuirseach automatically becomes the new king. He goes against his mother's agenda to pledge himself to Nilfgaard and instead unites all the clans against them. However, he does replace the Isle's elective monarchy with a hereditary one, killing some of his people to do so."}
