{"question": "What are the key characteristics of succubi and incubi?", "answer": "Succubi and incubi are creatures that appear as highly attractive humans. They seduce real humans, initially in dreams and then physically. They are not violent but draw energy from their victims, often leading to exhaustion or death. They are motivated by insatiable lust and do not crave human blood. They can be found near human settlements and shower their affections on various individuals, including pastors and holy men. When forced to fight, they defend themselves fiercely with surprising brute strength and can command fire."}
