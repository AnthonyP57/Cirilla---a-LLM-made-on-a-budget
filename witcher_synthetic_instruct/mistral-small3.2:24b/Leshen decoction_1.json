{"question": "How does the Leshen decoction's damage reflection work differently when Geralt is under the effects of Quen?", "answer": "The Leshen decoction will do the exact same damage regardless of how much damage Geralt receives when struck by an enemy, so even if he is hit while under the effects of Quen, the enemy will still receive all the reflected damage despite Geralt not taking any damage himself."}
