{"question": "What happens if Geralt refuses to take part in the assassination of King Radovid in the 'Reason of State' quest?", "answer": "If Geralt refuses to take part in the assassination, the quest fails. The journal entry notes that Geralt left the assassins' hideout before the fighting began, and although Roche and his band had overcome a great deal, they were unable to defeat Dijkstra's overwhelming numbers. Madame Irina's empty theater then hosted a brutal spectacle where the fiercest Temerian patriots met a bloody end."}
