{"question": "What is the origin of the name 'werebbubb' and how does it relate to other folklore creatures?", "answer": "The 'were-' part of 'werebbubb' is of archaic origin and means 'male', while '-\u0142ak' in the original 'bobo\u0142ak' has the elder meaning of 'skin' from the Proto-Slavic 'lak\u044a'. This makes 'bobo\u0142ak' share roots with folklore creatures like the Polish 'bobok' or 'bebok', and the English 'bogeyman' or 'bugbear'."}
