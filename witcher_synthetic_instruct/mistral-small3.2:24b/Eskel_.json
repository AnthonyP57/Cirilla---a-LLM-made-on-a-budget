{"question": "What is the significance of Eskel's scar in *The Witcher* series?", "answer": "Eskel's scar is a prominent feature on his face, running from the corner of his mouth across his cheek to his ear. It was not caused by a monster but rather by the blade of Deidre Ademeyn, his \"Unexpected Child.\" This traumatic experience may have contributed to his dislike for Yennefer, though he tries not to let it interfere with his friendship with Geralt. The scar is a physical reminder of his past and the dangers he has faced while walking the Path as a witcher."}
