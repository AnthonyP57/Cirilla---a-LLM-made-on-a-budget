{"question": "How can rotfiends be effectively dealt with and why is trapping them not recommended?", "answer": "Rotfiends are best dealt with by cutting off their food supply, which means burning all corpses in the area. Trapping them makes little or no sense because they are avid and skillful diggers, and they can quickly escape if threatened. Additionally, their bodies release explosive fumes when they die, making trapping them potentially dangerous."}
