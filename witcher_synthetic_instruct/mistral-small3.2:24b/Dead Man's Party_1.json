{"question": "What is the name of the quest in the Polish version and what does it mean?", "answer": "The quest is called \"Hulaj Dusza!\" in the Polish version, which is an idiom that translates to \"Partying Soul.\" The English equivalent would be \"Party Animal.\" The title is fitting because it refers to the spirit or \"soul\" of Vlodimir von Everec, who is doing the partying."}
