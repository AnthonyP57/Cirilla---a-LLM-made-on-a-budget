{"question": "What is the significance of Radovid's name in the context of The Witcher series?", "answer": "Radovid's name can be translated as 'A joyful sight' (RADOst - Joy, and VID - Look, Appearance). This is ironic given his character's ruthless and tyrannical nature, as he is far from being a joyful sight to his subjects or enemies. The name serves as a stark contrast to his actual personality and reign, highlighting the disparity between his name and his actions."}
