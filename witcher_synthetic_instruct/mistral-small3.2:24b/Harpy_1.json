{"question": "How do harpies typically hunt and what makes them difficult to fight?", "answer": "Harpies hunt in flocks and use their ability to fly to dive swiftly and strike their victims one by one before soaring back up out of reach. They are difficult to fight because they can attack from a distance, and while you're focusing on one or two, others can swoop in from behind. They are also cowardly and cautious, only attacking when they outnumber their foes."}
