{"question": "What are the physical characteristics and behaviors of chorts that make them dangerous?", "answer": "Chorts are smaller than fiends but still large enough to kill. They are denizens of dark and ancient woods and are known for destroying farmsteads, devouring anything available, including animals and humans. They communicate through grunts, snorts, and moans, and fight by charging at their opponents with brute force, biting, kicking, and striking with their claw-tipped paws. Their size and four-legged posture make them mostly unperturbed by the force of the Aard Sign, and they heal rapidly due to their regenerative powers."}
