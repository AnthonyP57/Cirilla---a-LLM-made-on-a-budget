{"question": "How do witchers typically combat hyms in The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt?", "answer": "Witchers combat hyms by using a silver sword coated with specter oil. They should evade or roll past the hym's claws and strike before it can react. Using signs like Igni and Yrden can help keep the hym visible and slow it down, making it easier to deal damage."}
