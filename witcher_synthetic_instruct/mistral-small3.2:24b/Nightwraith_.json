{"question": "What are the best times and methods to fight a nightwraith?", "answer": "Nightwraiths are strongest at night under the moonlight, so it's best to fight them during the day when they are weaker. To make them corporeal, use the Yrden Sign or a Moon Dust bomb. Once corporeal, use silver swords to finish them off. They are also susceptible to Specter Oil."}
