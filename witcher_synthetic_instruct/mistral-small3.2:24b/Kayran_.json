{"question": "What are the kayran's defensive mechanisms and how can they be overcome?", "answer": "The kayran defends itself with long, heavy tentacles covered in poisonous mucus and can spit venom. To overcome these defenses, one should cut off or immobilize the tentacles, approach its trunk carefully to avoid the venom, and find a way to pierce its tough armor to reach the inner organs."}
