{"question": "What is the behavior of a bullvore when it is with other creatures?", "answer": "A bullvore does not like the company of its own kind and is an individualist. It likes to show off before its lessers, sometimes accompanied by smaller, weaker beasts like nekkers and rotfiends. It is prone to giving peculiar displays wherein it kills its retinue in a fanciful manner, such as spitting acid on rotfiends that then explode."}
