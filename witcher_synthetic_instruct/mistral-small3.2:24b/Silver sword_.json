{"question": "What is the composition of a witcher's silver sword and why is it designed this way?", "answer": "A witcher's silver sword is traditionally made from meteoric iron, coated in silver, and inscribed with magical runes. It is designed this way because a purely silver sword would be too soft and useless, although the silver coating makes it very delicate and requires careful use."}
