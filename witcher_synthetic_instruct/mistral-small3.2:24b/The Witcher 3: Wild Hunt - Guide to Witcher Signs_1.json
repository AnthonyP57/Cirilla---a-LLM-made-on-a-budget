{"question": "Which sign is most effective against a single, very strong opponent that is vulnerable to Axii?", "answer": "The Axii sign is most effective against a single, very strong opponent that is vulnerable to it. It can temporarily stun the opponent, allowing for a free quick attack combo and then backing off while the sign recovers. This guerrilla-style combat can help defeat strong enemies several levels higher than your own, provided their level isn't too high that your attacks do virtually no damage."}
