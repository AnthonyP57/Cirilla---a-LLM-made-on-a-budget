{"question": "What is the significance of the Ale Festival in Mahakam?", "answer": "The Ale Festival in Mahakam is a significant event that takes place every twenty-five years and attracts thousands of participants from every part of the world. It is the only occasion where the gates of Mahakam are opened to everyone. When the festival ends, no one can enter the enclave except with the permission of the Elder-in-Chief, who usually gifts the visitor with the Leaden Ring, allowing them to stay in Mahakam as long as they desire."}
