{"question": "What is the best way to fight an Ekimma?", "answer": "To fight an Ekimma, use a silver sword and aim to cut it down as quickly as possible. Remember that they can regenerate health over time, so don't try to tire them out or wait for them to bleed to death. If possible, burn the body to ash and scatter it to the four winds. Black Blood potions can weaken them, and Moon Dust bombs can prevent them from teleporting. Dodging is essential, as their claws cannot be parried."}
