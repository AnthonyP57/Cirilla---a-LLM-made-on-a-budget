{"question": "How is the King or Queen of the Skellige Isles chosen?", "answer": "The King or Queen of the Skellige Isles is not chosen by heredity. Instead, the jarls of the influential clans elect the monarch. After the king or queen dies, a wake is held in their honor, during which an election is held. Potential candidates must prove themselves worthy by taking on tasks or missions to show they are the best fit for the throne. The jarls then select their next ruler, who is crowned under the hallowed tree, Gedyneith, in the western forests of Ard Skellig."}
