{"question": "What happens if you fail to complete 'An Eye for an Eye' and 'Redania's Most Wanted' before starting 'Reason of State'?", "answer": "You can still unlock 'Reason of State' as long as you complete 'A Deadly Plot' and bribe Dijkstra during 'Blindingly Obvious'. However, you must obtain all three quests and reach their practical ends. For 'An Eye for an Eye', you need to follow through until you see Ves' health bar appear, and for 'Redania's Most Wanted', you need to search Philippa's hideout and find the Polished crystal. You can fail the latter two quests at these points."}
