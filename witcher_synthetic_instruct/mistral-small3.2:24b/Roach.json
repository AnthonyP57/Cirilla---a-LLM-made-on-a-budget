{"question": "Why does Geralt of Rivia prefer to name his horses Roach?", "answer": "Geralt names his horses Roach because it refers to the roach fish (Rutilus rutilus), a common European freshwater fish. The name has nothing to do with cockroaches or the French name 'Roche', although the English term for the fish shares its origin with 'Roche' from the French word for 'rock'."}
