{"question": "How do endregas reproduce and what is the role of the queen in their colony?", "answer": "Endregas reproduce by hatching from eggs laid by impregnated queens in cocoons hanging from trees in nests. The queens are crucial for the colony's survival, as they lay the eggs and are hidden and protected by other endregas. When the nest is threatened, the queen emerges to fight ferociously."}
