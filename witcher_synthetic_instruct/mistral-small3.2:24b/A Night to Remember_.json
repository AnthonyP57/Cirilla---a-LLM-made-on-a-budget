{"question": "What happens to the bruxa after Geralt wounds her?", "answer": "After Geralt wounds the bruxa, she flees from the barn and falls outside, thrashing about and attempting to crawl away. Geralt follows her but collapses alongside her. The bruxa then reverts to her human form and her body is burned by the morning sun, leaving Geralt to ride away without taking the trophy."}
