{"question": "Where can you find Fleder fangs in The Witcher?", "answer": "Fleder fangs can be found in crypts, outside The Hairy Bear at night, in the garden outside the hospital at night, at the farthest end of the alley going by the dwarven blacksmith shop at night, and in Vizima's cemetery at night near the entrance to the Trade Quarter."}
