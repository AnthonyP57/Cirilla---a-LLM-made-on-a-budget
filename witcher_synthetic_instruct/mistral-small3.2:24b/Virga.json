{"question": "What are the main benefits and drawbacks of using the Virga potion in combat?", "answer": "The main benefit of Virga is that it increases the witcher's resistances, making him less vulnerable to special attacks like Poisoning, Incineration, and Bleeding. However, a major drawback is that it limits the witcher's ability to execute subtle attacks using the same effects, such as Poisoning, Incineration, or oils that increase Bleeding. Additionally, consuming Virga moderately increases Toxicity."}
