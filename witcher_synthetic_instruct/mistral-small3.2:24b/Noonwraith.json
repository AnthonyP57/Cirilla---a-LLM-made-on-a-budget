{"question": "What are noonwraiths and how do they appear in fields?", "answer": "Noonwraiths are monsters that appear in fields when the sun is at its highest. They are announced by swaying grains on a windless day. They dance in circles in the light of day and draw farmers in to join them, but since they are ghosts, no one who joins them leaves the circle alive."}
