Her full title, as proclaimed by Emhyr var Emreis, includes \"Queen of Cintra, Princess of Brugge, and Duchess of Sodden. Heiress to Inis Ard Skellig and Inis An Skellig, and suzeraine of Attre and Abb Yarra.\" Her name derives from the Elder Speech word *Zireael*, meaning \"Swallow.\" Ciri's story spans her childhood in Cintra, her training at Kaer Morhen, and her journey to fulfill her destiny as the Child of the Elder Blood, ultimately facing the White Frost to save multiple worlds. Her age varies slightly across the books, but she is generally depicted as a teenager during the main events of the series. In *The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt*, players follow her quest to reclaim her identity and confront her fate."}
