{"question": "How can a witcher effectively avoid a fiend's hypnosis attack?", "answer": "A witcher can avoid a fiend's hypnosis attack by moving behind or to the side of the fiend, as the hypnosis only works if the witcher is in view of the third eye. Additionally, a well-timed Samum bomb can permanently disable the fiend's third eye, preventing any use of hypnosis. Drinking an Enhanced Cat or Superior Cat potion also grants full immunity to the third eye attack."}
