{"question": "How does the Euphoria mutation interact with the Acquired Tolerance skill?", "answer": "The Euphoria mutation works extraordinarily well with Acquired Tolerance, as it not only increases the toxicity pool but also, being a skill from the alchemy tree, can be inserted into the additional slots. At maximum, Acquired Tolerance can increase the toxicity pool to 267 (184 in Patch 4.0), which brings the limit of damage and sign intensity increase up to 200.25% (138% in Patch 4.0)."}
