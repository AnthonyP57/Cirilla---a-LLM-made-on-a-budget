{"question": "What happens if you choose to fight the Frightener with Vesemir in the Prologue of The Witcher?", "answer": "If you choose to fight the Frightener with Vesemir, he will give you a red meteorite ore when talking with him later. Near the end of Chapter I at the bridge, you will face some Salamandra with a mutant dog, and the cutscene that plays will be generally negative about your choice here."}
