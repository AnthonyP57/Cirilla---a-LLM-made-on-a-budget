{"question": "What is the objective of a match in Gwent?", "answer": "The objective of a match in Gwent is to win 2 out of 3 rounds. This is represented by the Round Points, or red gems, next to each player's name. Losing a round loses you one of the points, if you lose both you lose the match. A draw makes both players lose a point unless you are the Nilfgaardian Empire."}
