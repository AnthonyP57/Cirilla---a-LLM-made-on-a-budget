{"question": "What are the Shrieker's main attacks and how can players exploit its weaknesses?", "answer": "The Shrieker's main attacks include a frontal peck, side swipes with its wings, and divebombs when in the air. Players can exploit its weaknesses by using draconid oil and the Aard sign, and by attacking its back, as it has no rear attacks, making it the easiest point to target."}
