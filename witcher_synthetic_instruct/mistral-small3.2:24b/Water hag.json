{"question": "What are some of the physical characteristics of a water hag?", "answer": "Water hags have wrinkled, wart-covered bodies that stand nearly two yards tall, with skin the color of a long-dead cadaver and stinking of muck and fish. They have bony growths two spans long sticking out from their backs, hair like a tangle of seaweed, and claws that would make a werewolf proud."}
