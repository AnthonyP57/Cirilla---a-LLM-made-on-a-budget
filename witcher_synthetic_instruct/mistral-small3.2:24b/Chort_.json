{"question": "What are the physical characteristics and behaviors of chorts in The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt?", "answer": "Chorts are smaller than fiends but still large enough to be dangerous. They have four legs, communicate through grunts, snorts, and moans, and are known for destroying farmsteads and devouring anything in their path, including animals and humans. They fight by charging at their opponents and using their claw-tipped paws to bite, kick, and strike."}
