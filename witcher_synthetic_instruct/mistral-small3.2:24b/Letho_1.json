{"question": "Who is Letho of Gulet and what is his role in The Witcher series?", "answer": "Letho of Gulet is a renegade witcher from the School of the Viper, best known as the \"Kingslayer\" for his involvement in the assassinations of at least two Nordling kings. His actions were part of a larger scheme orchestrated by the Nilfgaardian Emperor Emhyr var Emreis to destabilize the Northern Realms. Letho's story is central to *The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings*, where he is a key antagonist, and he reappears in *The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt* as a complex figure seeking redemption. His motivations and alliances shift throughout the series, making him a morally ambiguous character."}
