{"question": "What is a striga and how is it created?", "answer": "A striga is a human woman transformed into a monster by a curse. It is filled with hatred towards all living beings and only comes out on a full moon to hunt. The curse that turns females into strigas is not well-documented, but one example is Adda the White, daughter of Foltest, who was cursed prior to her birth."}
