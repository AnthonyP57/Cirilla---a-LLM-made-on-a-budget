{"question": "What is the Wild Hunt in The Witcher series?", "answer": "The Wild Hunt in The Witcher series is a spectral cavalcade of wraith-like horsemen who traverse the skies, serving as an omen of war, disaster, and abduction. Originating from a parallel world dominated by elves, the Hunt is composed of elven warriors' spiritual emanations, led by a powerful figure known as the King of the Hunt. Their primary goal in *The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt* is to capture Ciri, a young woman with unique magical abilities tied to their world. The Hunt's appearances are often linked to times of conflict or tragedy, and they are known to abduct souls to serve in their spectral ranks. The concept draws from European folklore, where similar legends foretell catastrophe and the abduction of mortals by supernatural forces."}
