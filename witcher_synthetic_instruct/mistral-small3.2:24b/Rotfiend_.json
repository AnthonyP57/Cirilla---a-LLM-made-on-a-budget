{"question": "How can you effectively deal with rotfiends in their habitat?", "answer": "To effectively deal with rotfiends, it's best to cut off their food supply by burning all corpses in the area. This is because rotfiends are avid diggers and will leave in search of new feeding grounds if they lack sustenance. Additionally, using Necrophage Oil is lethal to them, and other witchers' techniques like Signs, traps, and bombs are also effective."}
