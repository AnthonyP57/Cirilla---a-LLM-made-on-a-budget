{"question": "How can Geralt obtain the G'valchir sword in The Witcher game?", "answer": "Geralt can obtain the G'valchir sword as a reward from the dentist for completing the 'Won't Hurt a Bit' quest, or from the Royal huntsman for killing all ten trophy monsters in Chapter V. It can also be obtained by completing the 'Mud and Velvet' quest and keeping the money for yourself, which requires killing Captain Jean-Pierre for it. Additionally, it can be found on the Fields in Chapter IV, but only in the original version (1.0) of the game."}
