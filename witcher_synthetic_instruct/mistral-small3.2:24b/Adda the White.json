{"question": "What was the cause of Adda the White's stillbirth and her mother's death during childbirth?", "answer": "Adda the White was stillborn and her mother died during childbirth as a result of a curse. It's unclear if this was cast by Ostrit, a local magnate who was in love with Adda and attempted to put a curse on the king and it rebounded to the sister and their unborn child, or Foltest and Adda's mother, Sancia, who was also furious at the incestuous relationship between her children and may also have cursed their child."}
