{"question": "How does the kayran defend itself during combat in The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings?", "answer": "The kayran defends itself with long, heavy tentacles covered in poisonous mucus. These tentacles weigh as much as a trebuchet-arm and can deliver fatal blows. To defeat the kayran, one needs to cut off or immobilize its tentacles, approach its trunk, and find a way to pierce its tough armor to reach the inner organs."}
