{"question": "What is the significance of the roses of remembrance in The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings?", "answer": "The roses of remembrance are a new rose bush bearing purple roses that appear once Geralt brings Triss to the elven ruins. According to the legend of Eldan and Cymoril, these roses will wilt unless they are nourished with blood or sold. If one gives the flower to someone they love, they will live forever. Geralt then has the option to give the rose to Triss, or not."}
