{"question": "What was the primary reason for the decline of the Redanian spy service?", "answer": "The decline of the Redanian spy service began with the disappearance of its head, Sigismund Dijkstra. After his disappearance, a royal council ordered an audit of the spy corps, which led to a leak of agents' identities and their sources, resulting in many murders and the eventual dismantling of the organization."}
