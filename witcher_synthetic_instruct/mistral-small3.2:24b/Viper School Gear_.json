{"question": "What is the difference between the Viper School Gear set in the base game and the Hearts of Stone expansion?", "answer": "In the base game, the set only includes two low-leveled swords, one silver and one steel, previously owned by Kolgrim. In the Hearts of Stone expansion, the full armor set is introduced, which can be missed as it can only be obtained during certain quests."}
