Her lineage traces back to Lara Dorren, a powerful sorceress and the last heir of the Elder Blood. This lineage makes Ciri a target for various factions, including the Lodge of Sorceresses and the elven sages, who seek to control or manipulate her power. Her titles, such as 'Queen of Cintra' and 'Princess of Brugge,' underscore her royal heritage and the political stakes surrounding her. The contradiction in her age across different sources adds a layer of complexity to her character, highlighting the narrative's evolving nature."}
