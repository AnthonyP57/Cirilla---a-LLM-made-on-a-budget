{"question": "What are the consequences if Geralt chooses to keep Vivienne's secret from Guillaume in 'The Beast of Toussaint' quest?", "answer": "If Geralt keeps Vivienne's secret from Guillaume, several consequences unfold later in the game. Vivienne will eventually travel to Novigrad and later to Skellige, where she will die after seven years. Guillaume, on the other hand, becomes a drunk and can be found in front of The Pheasantry. If the quest is not completed, Guillaume's body can be found during 'The Night of Long Fangs,' and Vivienne will be seen crying at his grave in Orl\u00e9murs Cemetery."}
