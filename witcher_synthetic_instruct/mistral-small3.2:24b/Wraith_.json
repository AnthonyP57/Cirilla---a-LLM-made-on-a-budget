{"question": "What are some specific wraith variants encountered in The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings?", "answer": "In The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings, specific wraith variants include the Aedirnian/Kaedweni soldier wraiths found exclusively in Chapter 2 and the Nilfgaardian soldier wraith featured in the Chapter 1 quest In the Claws of Madness. Unlike traditional wraiths, these variants will flail around when set on fire, giving Geralt temporary respite while they are out of action."}
