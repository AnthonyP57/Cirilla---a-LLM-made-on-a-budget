{"question": "What is the significance of Eskel's scar in *The Witcher* series?", "answer": "Eskel's scar is a significant detail in *The Witcher* series, both in terms of his character development and his relationships. The scar, which runs from the corner of his mouth across his cheek to his ear, was not caused by a monster but by the blade of Deidre Ademeyn, his \"Unexpected Child.\" This traumatic experience is suggested to be the root of Eskel's dislike for Yennefer, though he tries not to let it interfere with his friendship with Geralt. The scar also contributes to his intimidating appearance, which is often noted by characters like Ciri, who initially finds him frightening. Despite his scar, Eskel is known for his calm, patient, and polite demeanor, which contrasts with his physical appearance."}
