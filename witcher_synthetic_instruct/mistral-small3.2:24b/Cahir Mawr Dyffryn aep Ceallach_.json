{"question": "What happened to Cahir after he was spared by Ciri on Thanedd Island?", "answer": "After being spared by Ciri, some of the Scoia'tael found him while he was bleeding out, but before they could help him, Geralt attacked and killed all the elves. Geralt then asked Cahir why he should spare him, to which Cahir responded that he was the reason Ciri survived the Slaughter of Cintra, having rescued her from the fires. When Cahir opened his eyes again, the witcher was gone. He then tried to head to Tor Lara tower, but when the tower exploded, he was knocked unconscious and his body was found by Isengrim."}
