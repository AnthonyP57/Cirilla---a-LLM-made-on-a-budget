{"question": "What are some of the key behaviors of wyverns when hunting or fighting?", "answer": "Wyverns usually attack from the air, aiming to knock their prey down with their wings. After landing, they attack with their tooth-filled beak, trying to draw attention away from their most dangerous weapon: the stinger found at the end of their long tail. They can also spit venom from a distance and inject it directly into their victim through the stinger."}
