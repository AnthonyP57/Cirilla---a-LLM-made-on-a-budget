{"question": "What is the motto of the book 'Baptism of Fire'?", "answer": "The motto of the book is a quote from the Dire Straits song 'Brothers in Arms': 'Through these fields of destruction Baptisms of fire I've witnessed your suffering As the battle raged higher And though they did hurt me so bad In the fear and alarm You did not desert me My brothers in arms'."}
