{"question": "Geralt of Rivia", "answer": "Geralt of Rivia, also known as Geralt z Rivii in Polish, is the protagonist of Andrzej Sapkowski's *The Witcher* series. A mutant witcher trained at Kaer Morhen, Geralt possesses superhuman abilities, including enhanced reflexes, strength, and longevity. He wields two swords\u2014a silver one for monsters and a steel one for humans\u2014and uses alchemy and witcher Signs to aid in combat. Unlike typical witchers, Geralt retains empathy and emotional depth, often navigating morally ambiguous situations. His journey spans novels, games (e.g., *The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt*), and adaptations, including Netflix's *The Witcher* series. Key traits include his white hair (turned by stress), his bond with Yennefer and Ciri, and his role as a reluctant hero in a world where morality is complex. His name in Elder Speech, *Gwynbleidd*, translates to 'white wolf,' reflecting his iconic symbol."}
