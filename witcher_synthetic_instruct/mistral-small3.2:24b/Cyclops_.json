{"question": "What are some combat tactics recommended for fighting a cyclops in The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt?", "answer": "Some combat tactics recommended for fighting a cyclops include rolling to the side or behind it to evade attacks, avoiding standing in one place, and being cautious when a cyclops raises both hands in the air as it may perform a ground-pound. Additionally, using the Yrden Sign can help witchers do more work when within sword range, and Quen is suggested for handling them. Axii can also temporarily confuse a cyclops."}
