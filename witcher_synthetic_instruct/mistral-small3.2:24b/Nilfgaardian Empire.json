{"question": "What is the Nilfgaardian Empire and its significance in The Witcher universe?", "answer": "The Nilfgaardian Empire is a powerful and ancient realm in the far south of the Continent in *The Witcher* universe. Its capital is the city of Nilfgaard, located on the river Alba. The Empire arose through conquests, assimilating nearby kingdoms and cultures, and is known for its aggressive expansionist policies. The Empire's population is diverse, but its authorities promote \"Nilfgaardization,\" replacing local customs with those of the \"proper\" Lower Alban heritage. The Empire is also notable for being relatively tolerant toward nonhuman races, offering them a safer home compared to the Northern Realms, though under a harsh but just imperial system. The Empire's military is one of the most formidable on the Continent, with a disciplined army and a sophisticated intelligence network. Its dominant religion is the cult of the Great Sun, symbolized by the sun on its coat of arms. The Empire's constant wars and conquests are driven by its economy's dependence on the spoils of war and slave labor, making expansion a necessity for its survival. The Nilfgaardian Empire is often compared to historical empires like Rome, particularly in its military discipline, cultural assimilation, and sense of superiority among its subjects."}
