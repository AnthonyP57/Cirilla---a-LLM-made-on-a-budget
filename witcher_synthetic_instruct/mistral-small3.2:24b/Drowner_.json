{"question": "What are the physical characteristics of drowners?", "answer": "Drowners are skinny, tall, and bony creatures with slimy and green skin and hair. They have wide palms, membranes between their fingers, and a fin. Their eyes are round and fishlike, giving them a rather dumb expression. They also have gills and dorsal fins, which suggest they are well-adapted to their watery environment."}
