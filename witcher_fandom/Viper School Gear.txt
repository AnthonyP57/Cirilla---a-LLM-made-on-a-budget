Viper School Gear
Viper School Gear is a set of armor and swords from The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt and its Hearts of Stone expansion. The set was designed for witchers that were part of the School of the Viper.
Note: all legendary gear are stronger versions of base game gear in New Game +.
The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt
In the base game the set only includes two low leveled swords, one silver and one steel, previously owned by Kolgrim from the School of the Viper. When you collect the first weapon schematic, it will start a new Scavenger Hunt secondary quest.

Hearts of Stone expansion
The full armor set is introduced in the Hearts of Stone expansion. There is no secondary quest associated with this gear, meaning that it can be completely missed as they can only be obtained during certain quests:
The armor diagrams are bought from Countess Mignole during the Open Sesame! quest
The venomous steel sword diagram is found within the Borsodi vault during the Open Sesame! quest
The venomous silver sword has no crafting diagram, but the forged blade can be found within Gaunter O'Dimm's world
For a more detailed walkthrough on getting all the pieces, see Scavenger Hunt: Viper School Gear.

Trivia
The set is almost identical to the armor that Geralt starts the game with, however the stats are different and the Viper set has a snakeskin pattern on it.
