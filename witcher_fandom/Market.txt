Market
There are several market areas in Vizima.
These include:
the area within the palisade of the Inn in the Outskirts
Merchant Street in the Temple Quarter
the Trade Quarter, which boasts
Salt Square
Tanners Square
The Alley along the Walls
There are also a number of individual merchants who choose to do business outside these established market areas. People like blacksmiths and armourers, several independent spirits like Kalkstein, Thaler and the druids, and other nonconformists who just happen to have some entrepreneurial tendencies.
