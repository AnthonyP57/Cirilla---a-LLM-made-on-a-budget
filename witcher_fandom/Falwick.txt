Falwick
Falwick was the count of Moën and a member of the Order of the White Rose, under the service of Duke Hereward.
Biography
Count Falwick was of noble birth, and took an early interest in swordsmanship. He later joined the Order of the White Rose and was knighted. After a time, he took Arthur Tailles, an arrogant young knight, under his wing and trained him.
Years later, Falwick and Tailles traveled to the Temple of Melitele in Ellander to ask Geralt of Rivia to leave the duchy by order of Hereward. Geralt and Nenneke started to aggressively argue with Tailles, though Falwick remained calm, despite his hatred for the witcher.
Later in the city of Ellander, Falwick and Tailles once again stopped Geralt and his friend Dandelion, along with the help of Captain Dennis Cranmer. Falwick announced that the witcher must fight Tailles, and made it obvious of the rules as well as his favor towards the knight. After the duel was finished, Falwick left and continued with his duties.
The Hexer
In The Hexer TV series, Falwick's role was greatly expanded, as befitting of Geralt's nemesis. He was first introduced as Gwidon the witcher, but became a renegade, was expelled and became a recurring character. He worked as a spy for Nilfgaard, under orders to find Ciri and bring her to Emhyr var Emreis, the Emperor of Nilfgaard. Ultimately, Falwick fell at the hands of Geralt.
He is portrayed by Maciej Kozłowski.
