La Valette Castle
La Valette Castle is the main keep of the House of La Valette. It's a walled town that boasts the greatest fortifications in Temeria, and perhaps in all the Northern Kingdoms in The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings. The citadel is located near the strategically important White Bridge, which connects the banks of the Pontar.

Journal entry
During my travels I visited the dynastic abode of the La Valette family several times. Anyone who considers Vizima an impressive city is unlikely to have seen the ancestral citadel of the La Valettes. The immensity of the fortress is simply breathtaking, to the extent that calling it a mere castle is either a gross inaccuracy or a jest. Expanded over generations, the walled town boasts the greatest fortifications in Temeria, and perhaps in all the Northern Kingdoms. The citadel is located near the strategically important White Bridge, which connects the banks of the Pontar. It commands the entire area, including nearby trade routes and the crossing. No wonder then that the rebellion of the La Valettes disturbed Foltest's sleep.
