Season of Storms
Season of Storms (Polish: Sezon burz) is the sixth Witcher novel and eighth overall book in the series written by Andrzej Sapkowski. It is not a follow-up to the spin-off of the Witcher series proper, but instead a midquel, set before "The Witcher" short story but after most of the other stories in The Last Wish.
The book was published in English on 22 May 2018 and translated by David French. It's available in hardcover, paperback, and digital format.
Summary
Geralt of Rivia is a Witcher, one of the few capable of hunting the monsters that prey on humanity. A mutant who is tasked with killing unnatural beings. He uses magical signs, potions, and the pride of every Witcher - two swords, steel and silver.
But a contract has gone wrong, and Geralt finds himself without his signature weapons. Now he needs them back, because sorcerers are scheming, and across the world clouds are gathering.
The season of storms is coming...

Inaccuracies
The letters sent by mages inform that the year the action takes place in is 1245. This is inconsistent with information provided in The Tower of the Swallow, which implicates that Dandelion would not leave the academy, devote his life to poetry, and meet Geralt until 1248. The correct year of action appears to be 1250, a year after Geralt leaves Yennefer after their time spent in Vengerberg.
A possible explanation is that mages use a different dating system from the rest of the Continent and assume that the Resurrection takes place 5 years later.
