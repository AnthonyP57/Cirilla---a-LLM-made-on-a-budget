Forbidden art
Forbidden Arts and Dark Arts are umbrella terms for magical practices that are banned by Brotherhood of Sorcerers or other regulating bodies due to their inherent danger or immorality.
They involve, among others:
goetia
necromancy
mutations on intelligent races
Fire magic is also sometimes counted, but it appears to be discouraged rather than outright forbidden. Mistress of Fire magic, Klara Larissa de Winter, was a respectable mage and the foundress of Aretuza.
