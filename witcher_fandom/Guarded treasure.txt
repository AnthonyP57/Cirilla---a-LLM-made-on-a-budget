Guarded treasure
There are a number of guarded treasures scattered about the various regions in The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, and its expansions, Hearts of Stone expansion and Blood and Wine expansion. In general, they consist of a single powerful or few weaker monsters that must be killed before a treasure can be looted, with a few exceptions where the enemy appears only after the treasure is looted.
In that regard, they aren't much different from bandit camps, but guarded treasures typically contain higher-quality loot and relic equipment in particular. Some have at least partially fixed loot (including all Blood and Wine expansion locations), but a lot are randomized.

Note: Almost all bandit camps in Toussaint are under the influence of hanse bases controlling their regions and, if discovered after the respective hanse leader is eliminated, these bandit camps may turn into guarded treasures as well.
