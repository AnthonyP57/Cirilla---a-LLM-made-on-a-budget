Notes
Bug - This item is a bit glitchy and can disappear from inventory. If it is won from Sendler along with the stuffed she-troll's head, or looted after killing the Troll of Flotsam, it should be the last item obtained for the Melitele's Heart ritual. Care should be taken not to carry it around for too long; the replacement cost is rather high. Unless it is being used directly after acquisition, it's best to keep it in storage.
Felicia Cori also sells this item in Chapters II (Iorveth's path) and III.
In Dark Mode, it is needed in Chapter III to craft the Kinslayer's trousers.
