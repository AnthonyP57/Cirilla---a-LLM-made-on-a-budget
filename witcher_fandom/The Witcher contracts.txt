The Witcher contracts
Contracts are optional quests which Geralt can undertake if he so chooses. They all come with a reward for the work done and typically entail getting some alchemical ingredients for another individual who lacks the monster slaying and skinning skills of a witcher. All of these quests can be obtained by reading the notice boards. There is at least one notice board per major location in The Witcher.
 Contract Items
Once you have read and thereby accepted the contract, the items no longer have any practical use. They can be safely thrown away or put into storage to free up inventory space. If you carry the item with you when finishing a quest (getting your reward), the item will disappear.
