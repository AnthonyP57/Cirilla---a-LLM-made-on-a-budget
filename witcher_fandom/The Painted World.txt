The Painted World
The Painted World is an otherworldly location that originally only existed in Iris von Everec's mind when she was alive and was made up of blurred memories that she wished to forget. However, after she died, the world gained more substance, making her fears grow out of proportion with the original memories.
In 1272, Geralt arrived here to obtain the violet rose that was Olgierd's last gift to her before he left.
Notes
Depending on one's actions at the end of Scenes From a Marriage, this world may cease to exist.
