Painting of Iris holding a violet rose
Painting of Iris holding a violet rose is a quest item in the Hearts of Stone expansion.
After entering The Painted World and dealing with Iris von Everec's final nightmare, she'll appear and talk with Geralt. You can then ask she give up the rose or not. If you refuse to take it, you will instead get this painting and can turn it in to Olgierd.

Notes
Unlike other paintings, this one can't be used to decorate Corvo Bianco. It's not a matter of having access, it simply doesn't appear on the painting selection screen.
