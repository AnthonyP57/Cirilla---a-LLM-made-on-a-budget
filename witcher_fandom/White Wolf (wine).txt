White Wolf (wine)
White Wolf is a weak alcoholic drink in the Blood and Wine expansion.
It can only obtained if Geralt ends the feud between Liam de Coronata and Matilda de Vermentino during the Wine Wars quest line. If he does, at the end of Wine Wars: Belgaard they will ask Geralt to come back to them in 3 days and after doing so, this is one of three options given to name a wine that they want to honor him with. Batches of 5 bottles of the chosen wine will then be sent to Corvo Bianco once a week, lootable in the cellar.
The other two options are Geralt of Rivia and the higher quality Butcher of Blaviken.
