Borsody family
Borsody (Borsodi in the original Sapkowski novels) is the surname of an elite Redanian family. They were once merchants with horses and sheep, but by the mid-13th century they had managed to rise so much that the Borsody Auction House became the largest and most reputable in the Northern Realms, located on Novigrad's main square in an impressive three-story building.
