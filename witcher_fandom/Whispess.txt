Whispess
I'd be your best... and last.
- Whispess, The Witcher 3: Wild HuntAudio version: Media:Whispess voice line.ogg
Whispess was one of the three Velen Crones in Crookback Bog. The other two were Weavess and Brewess and they were supposed to be daughters of She-Who-Knows.
As Weavess, Whispess has the ability to transform into a flock of crows, in addition to shapeshifting into a young woman, Like her sisters, and the shape of those they feed on. The sisters also have power over the monsters of their lands.
Biography
Whispess once lived in the Chuchote Cave in Toussaint, where she peered into a certain knight's heart, she saw that it was black and refused him aid. The knight reacted with wrath and burned her alive in the cave. Soon afterward, the knight went mad and killed himself – claiming he was tortured by a strange voice whispering in his ear that no one else could hear.

Journal entry
The Crones of Velen were not just old — they were literally ancient, having been around since the reign of the first human kings and possibly even since the coming of the elves.
Of the three ghastly sisters, the Whispess was the most ancient, or at least so claimed the swamp dwellers' whispered legends. Whispered, for if they spoke too loudly the Crone would hear it — for she demanded tribute in the form of human ears, which she hung from trees and through which, using primeval magic, she heard all that happened in the swamp.
Yet no magic, new or old, could save her from Cirilla's wrath.
