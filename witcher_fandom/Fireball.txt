Fireball
Fulmen Sphaericus, commonly known as lightning ball or fireball, is a powerful combat spell which causes an explosion wounding everyone and setting aflame everything within radius up to 10 meters. Because of its unpredictable properties it is advised to use it only under the open sky, as in interiors it can cause a shockwave wounding the caster and their companions.
It is described as pretty useful against even the most dangerous energumens, but hardly noticeable by fiery dragons.
