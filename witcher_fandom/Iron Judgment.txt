Iron Judgment
The Iron Judgment refers to the strict and relentless reign of King Radovid V after his victory at the end of the Third Northern War, when he annexed the whole North in the Kingdom of Redania and was appointed "Protector of the North".
During this period, the Royal Redanian Army set the North on fire trying to suppress the several uprisings and oppositions against Radovid, clashing at least with the military of Aedirn and Mahakam, against the Free Company of the Iron Falcons and against fleets from Skellige over the control of the Great Sea.
Perhaps the most defining feature of Radovid's reign was his policy of relentless witch hunts from 1272 to 1276. All over the North, groups such as mages, non-humans, herbalists and soothsayers were burned at the stake in mass numbers.
