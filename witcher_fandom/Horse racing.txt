Horse racing
In The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt and its expansions, horse racing is an activity in which Geralt may partake along with his horse Roach. In general, a horse race will have a quest associated with it, in which Geralt must place a bet with a bookmaker. If Geralt loses a race, the amount bet on it will be lost, and in some cases the associated quest or quest objective may fail. Conversely, if Geralt wins a race, he will receive an amount of crowns which is double that of the bet. In some races, horse equipment prizes may be on offer, which Geralt can use to raise Roach's stamina, maximum fear level, or his own carrying capacity.
