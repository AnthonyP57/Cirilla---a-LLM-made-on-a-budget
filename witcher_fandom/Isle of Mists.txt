History
In 1272, Avallac'h sailed to the Isle of Mists with Ciri to escape the Wild Hunt. While they had successfully gotten away from them at Hindarsfjall, Eredin had still managed to curse Avallac'h as they ran, which was slowly taking effect. Before it fully took him over though, the elf put Ciri in a deep, sleep-like state to hide her on the isle and prevent her from being detected by the Wild Hunt. He then left the isle, sailing back to Skellige, as the curse transformed him into Uma.
Later, when Avallac'h's curse was lifted thanks to the work of Yennefer and the witchers at Kaer Morhen, he revealed where Ciri was. Geralt of Rivia then traveled to the isle and found Ciri, who awoke upon his arrival. However, this also meant the Wild Hunt could detect her again and as they were leaving the island, the Wild Hunt appeared, forcing Ciri to use her powers to teleport herself and Geralt to Kaer Morhen.

Trivia
The Island is based on traditional enchanted islands from different folklore. Specifically, it shares similaries with Buyan, an island in Slavic folklore which was hidden in a cloud of mists.
The Dwarves encountered on this island during the main quest are a clear reference to Snow White, the story made popular in the Disney movie. There are seven dwarves on the Isle of Mists, and several directly reference characters such as Sleepy and Sneezy. Even Ciri being in a death like slumber is similar to the princess in the tale.
