White Lady
The White Lady was the specter of a woman who was buried alive in the catacombs of Rozrog. During the wedding of Geralt and Yennefer which was hosted there, several of the guests reportedly saw her, although some skeptics claimed that it was in fact simply one of the drunken female guests.
Trivia
Another phantom who appeared during the wedding was the ghost of a man named Willem, also known as "The Devil".
