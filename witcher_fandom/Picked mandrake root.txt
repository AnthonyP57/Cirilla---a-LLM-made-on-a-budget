Picked mandrake root
Picked mandrake root is a quest item in the Blood and Wine expansion. No matter how the situation resolves between Anna Henrietta and Sylvia Anna, Geralt will join Regis in the MÃ¨re-Lachaiselongue Cemetery and eventually go looking for more mandrake roots.
It's important to don the given mask and gloves, as picking just one will raise Geralt's toxicity levels past 50% and thus picking the next without lowering the toxicity would be fatal.
