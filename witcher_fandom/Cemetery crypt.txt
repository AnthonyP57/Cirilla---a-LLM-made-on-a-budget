Cemetery crypt
The cemetery crypt is located inside Vizima's cemetery, in the north section.
In the crypt, you can find the corpse of the real Raymond (the detective). This proves that the "Raymond" who is currently passing as the detective is actually Azar Javed, and that the other suspects are innocent.
There are also some ghouls, alghouls, fleders and cemetaurs to fight and there is some interesting loot. Cat potions and Necrophage Oil are useful.
In Chapter III, the Scoia'tael have locked some humans in the crypt, and Geralt has to choose whether to save them from the ghouls or pursue the Squirrels.
