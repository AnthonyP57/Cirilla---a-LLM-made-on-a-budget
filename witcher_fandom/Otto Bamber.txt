- Otto Bamber
Otto Bamber is a halfling herbalist residing at his hut outside Oxenfurt. He plays gwent with the Scoia'tael deck and gives a random, non-unique card if beaten.
He sells many alchemical formulae and ingredients, including rotfiend blood and nekker warrior's liver, both of which are otherwise only available as monster loot.
Biography
In 1272, Bamber accommodated Ewald Borsodi and his associates in a hidden cellar under his hut, while the group planned a heist on the Borsodi Brothers' Auction House. During this time, the alchemist was also accosted by Fallen Knights, though he was protected from them by Geralt of Rivia.
In the same year, Bamber's apprentice Folkert, whom Bamber sent to Deadwight Wood to collect han fiber, went missing. Bamber then posted a notice on Brunwich's notice board to appeal for someone to search for Folkert. Geralt of Rivia responded to the notice, and searched for the missing apprentice near the village of Erde.
If Geralt spared the couple but told the truth to Otto: Bamber hired a group of mercenaries to kill the elderly couple who cannibalized Folkert, regardless of whether or not Folkert was already killed by wolves beforehand.
