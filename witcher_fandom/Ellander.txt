Ellander
Here, in Pontar Valley, lies the duchy of Ellander.
- pg.269, Blood of Elves (U.K. edition)
Ellander is a duchy of Temeria and located east of Vizima. It is here that the Temple of Melitele is located.
National Emblems
Princes of Ellander descending from King Dezmod used arms with silver lilies highlighting their royal ancestry. When their line vanished, King Foltest gave his faithful vassal Hereward a ducal title and coat of arms (present in the infobox) displaying a treefold silver gonfalon of the cult of Melitele.
