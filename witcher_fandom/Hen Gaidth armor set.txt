Hen Gaidth armor set
Hen Gaidth armor set is a special type of heavy armor introduced in the Blood and Wine expansion. All the parts (including a sword and mask) can only be acquired during the main quest What Lies Unseen while inside the Unseen Elder's lair.
When wearing at least 3 pieces of the set, a bonus is given: Killing opponents restores Vitality. The amount of Vitality restored equals 1% of maximum Vitality for each element of the set worn.

Notes
Cantata is theme-wise the silver sword addition to the set. However, it doesn't contribute to the set bonus when equipped.
This set has a black counterpart known as Tesham Mutna armor set.
Both sets have the same properties and same "set bonus", and even count for the same set bonus. However, this set provides more armor.
This set is permanently missable. It is possible to skip going to the Unseen Elder's lair if one chooses to find Syanna and do the Beyond Hill and Dale... quest instead of the Blood Simple and What Lies Unseen quest pair, which is the only opportunity to go through the lair.
Trivia
This armor is likely based on the armor worn by Gary Oldman as Dracula in the beginning of the 1992 movie, "Bram Stoker's Dracula."
