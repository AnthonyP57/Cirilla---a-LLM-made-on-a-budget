Fayrlund
Fayrlund is a village located on the cliffs overlooking the western bay of Ard Skellig.
Due to their proximity to a dense forest, their elders believe in a powerful entity they call the Woodland Spirit, who is in fact a very old and powerful Leshen. This new form of worshiping has caused a great deal of controversy between the elders and the younger warriors and hunters of the village, who believe this being should be put to the sword.
The inhabitants of Fayrlund have always kept a certain distance from their fellow Skelliger - and a great deal more from foreigners. They are a reserved and tight-lipped lot, which has allowed a great many unflattering rumors to emerge concerning them.
