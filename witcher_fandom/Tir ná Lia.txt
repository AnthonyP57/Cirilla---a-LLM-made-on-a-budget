Tir ná Lia
I'm glad to know you appreciate it. Elven architecture is a bit more sophisticated than yours.
- Avallac'h in response to Geralt's impression, The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt
Tir ná Lia is the capital of the world of the Aen Elle and was governed by Auberon Muircetach. The river Easnadh runs through it. According to Ciri, the city has a look similar to that of Shaerrawedd.
Its buildings are described as light, open on all sides (thus resembling gazebos or arbours), seeming so airy, delicate and ephemeral that they actually look not like buildings, but phantoms of buildings. They are built of marble, alabaster, and malachite, and adorned with stucco, terracotta, and mosaics. There are many bridges and terraces, peristiles, cloisters and balconies, sculptures and monuments.
According to Galahad, this land is known by people of his world and have various names: Faërie (by Britons), Annwn (by Celtic druids) or Elfland (by Saxons).
