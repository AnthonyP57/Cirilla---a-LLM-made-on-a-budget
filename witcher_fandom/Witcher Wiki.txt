Witcher Wiki
Helping Out
All pages can be edited and you are welcome to join us and contribute to this wiki. If you have any questions about the wiki or helping out, you can ask one of Witcher Wiki's administrators. 
If you are new to wikis, you may want to read the tutorial.
Or, you could try helping cleaning up some articles that need cleaning up.
Another helpful activity would be to check the list of wanted pages for frequently linked-to articles that don't exist yet.
If you want to experiment with editing a wiki, please do it in your sandbox, not in articles. (Go to your profile then type "/Sandbox" after your name in the URL to access it).
Want to read up on some guidelines? Check out editing guidelines, the Manual of Style, and the image guidelines.
For questions, suggestions or other concerns regarding this wikia contact an admin.
