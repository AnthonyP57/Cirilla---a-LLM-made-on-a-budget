Map description
The fabulous gardens on the shores of Seidhe Llygad were, like Beauclair Palace, nearly destroyed during the Elven Conflicts. Master Faramond, who led the renovation efforts, did what he could, but some of the more delicate plants could not be saved. Today this popular recreation spot for courtiers is filled mainly with spruces, olive trees, Beauclair oaks, rose bushes, juniper thickets, rhododendrons and, of course, grapevines.
