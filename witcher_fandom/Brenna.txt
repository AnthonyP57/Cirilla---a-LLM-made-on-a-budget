Brenna
Brenna was a fishing village near Old Bottoms and Maribor on the Chotla river and the site of one of the most often cited battles in the Second Nilfgaard War. After the battle, the village was rebuilt and became a prosperous settlement.
Notes
Maps supplied with The Witcher, sequel and generally any maps available regarding the Witcher series inaccurately locate the site to the north of Maribor. Given that the village of Brenna is on the Chotla, and the Chotla is south and west of Maribor.
