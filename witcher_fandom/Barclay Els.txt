Biography
Years after the Battle of Brenna, the colonel arrived in Vergen after tragedy during the first attempt to kill a chelonodrake which had been blocking the possibility to exploit the silver mine, when a bunch of dwarven warriors were accidentally burned alive by Saskia in her dragon form. His arrival meets with great enthusiasm of the gathered dwarves satisfied with incoming of the far-famed commander and resulted in an instant acclamation him as Elder of Vergen.
After taking a government, the new Elder was disappointed with the lack of democracy caused by Saskia's high position. He also began efforts to conclude a peace treaty with the Nilfgaardian Empire, promising the neutrality during the eventual war.
Although he showed a skeptical attitude toward an idea about chelonodrake hunt trying to prevent further victims, after coming of Geralt of Rivia he joined the tortohunters in his own person. Killed during a hunt, he was ceremonially buried in catacombs beneath Vergen.
