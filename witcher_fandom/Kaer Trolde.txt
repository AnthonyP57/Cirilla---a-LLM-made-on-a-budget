Kaer Trolde
Kaer Trolde is a port city reigned over by jarls from Clan an Craite on the coast of Ard Skellig, the largest of the Skellige islands. It is usually compared to black and amorphous like a huge marine crustacean thrown on the shore by the waves. It is built just under the island's main stronghold whose highest towers make the entire archipelago visible.
The port serves as the docks for the Jarl of Skellige's fleet and is accessible by longships and triremes. It is home to many sailors, fishers, and warriors but also alchemists, goldsmiths, glass blowers, and jewelers. The island branch of a dwarven Cianfanelli Bank is also situated here.
According to legend, Grymmdjarr, the founder of Clan an Craite, carved the keep that overlooks the city with his bare hands.

Trivia
A tapestry in the Kaer Trolde throne room depicts warriors battling the Ice Giant. Its style makes reference to an actual 11th century artifact, the Bayeux Tapestry, which shows William the Conqueror's successful battles for control over England.
"Trolde" is the Danish word for "trolls".
Notes
The city is downsized to a small settlement in The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt.
