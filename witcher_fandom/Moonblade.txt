Moonblade
Moonblade, or Moon Blade, is a legendary silver sword. According to the tales, it was forged by smiths from Ellander for Wolf Witcher Olach of Ban Gleán who was hired to get rid of a demon tormenting the duchy. It was anointed by one of the few remaining local priestesses of Lilvani, Goddess of the Moon. Folk say that Lilvani herself guided the witcher's blade when he confronted the demon.
The Witcher
Moonblade is a silver sword of elven design. This deadly silver sword is given to Geralt by the Royal huntsman in Chapter V as a possible reward (the other possible reward being G'valchir) for bringing in all ten trophy monster heads. Merely killing the monsters is not sufficient, their heads must be returned for the quests to count. It is used against monsters and has little effect on humans.
Described by the Royal huntsman as "splendid", and it is. Can neither be bought nor sold.
It is the highest damage silver sword in the game, the equivalent steel sword being G'valchir.

Moonblade returns in the second game and can be imported.
