Whoreson Junior's casino
This three-story building situated in The Bits district of Novigrad hosts the biggest illegal clandestine casino of the city.
Administered by the crime lord Cyprian Wiley, is frequented only by those citizens who can afford the buy-in of 200 crowns and the high-stakes for playing Gwent, namely only thieves, scammers, fences and corrupt politicians.
The first floor is used as a pub, the second floor is used for the games and the bets, while the last floor is used for the high-stakes games, or even as an interrogation room for the players considered a bit too lucky by the owner.
