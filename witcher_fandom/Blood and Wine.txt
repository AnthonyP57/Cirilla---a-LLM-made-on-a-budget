Official Statement
Blood and Wine, a 20-hour-plus tale that will introduce the all-new in-game region of Toussaint, will take Geralt to a land untainted by war, where an atmosphere of carefree indulgence and knightly ritual masks an ancient, bloody secret.
The expansion features new characters, new dangerous monsters, new armors, new weapons, and a new Gwent deck of cards. It will also introduce a new gameplay mechanic armor dyeing in addition to so called Mutations. The quests are designed for Geralt characters level 34 or higher. Its content can be accessed before and during New Game +.
Become professional monster slayer Geralt of Rivia and explore Toussaint, a remote land untouched by war, where you will unravel the horrifying secret behind a beast terrorizing the kingdom. With all trails leading to dead ends, only a witcher can solve the mystery and survive the evil lurking in the night. Introducing an entirely new realm to traverse, new characters and monsters, Blood and Wine is a 30+ hour adventure full of dark deeds, unexpected twists, romance and deceit.

The new region of Toussaint has never before been seen in The Witcher series and contains:
Over 90 new quests.
Over 40 new points of interest.
Over 30 hours of new adventures.
Dynamic Point of Interest system – interacting with the main POI of a given area will affect adjacent points of interest (e.g. killing bandits in their main hideout located in a ruined castle will affect the number of enemies in surrounding camps).
14000 lines of dialogue (Hearts of Stone had 6000 lines).
100 individual pieces of armour (this includes new witcher sets).
More than 30 new weapons.
More than 20 new monsters.

All new armour dye mechanic – every piece of witcher gear can have its color changed by using a dye. Dyes can be obtained in various ways: they can be bought from the new dye merchant; crafted from a recipe; dropped as loot. Dyes can only be obtained in Toussaint.
Mutations
For main page, see Mutations (Blood and Wine).

Opponents knocked down by Aard freeze and die instantly. Opponents that were not knocked down become frozen.
