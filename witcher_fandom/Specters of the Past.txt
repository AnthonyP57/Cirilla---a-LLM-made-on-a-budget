Specters of the Past
Specters of the Past is a battle in Thronebreaker: The Witcher Tales.
Entry
While the human kingdoms are mere hundreds of years old, the chronichles of Mahakam stretch back millenia. Over its long history, the mountainous reign has been home to many great discoveries, heroic deeds... And terrible crimes. The dwarves, howeve, preferred to keep silent about past conflicts - instead emphazising brotherhood above all else. Yet, the stain of shed blood on alabaster snow is difficult to truly forgive and forget... And its continued memory attracts beasts that thrive on injustice and suffering.
