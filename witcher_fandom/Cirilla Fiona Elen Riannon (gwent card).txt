Notes
This and the Geralt card have the highest base Strength points at 15.
As of Patch 4.0 there are two versions of this card, one with Muster and another without. Which one you get depends on whether you have the Roach card unlocked or not.
Note that if the Roach card was not redeemed before December 31, 2023, there is not a way to obtain it afterwards from My Rewards. While one can use console commands, it will not appear redeemed on the account itself.
