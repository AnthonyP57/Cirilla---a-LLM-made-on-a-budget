Tips
The resistance stacks directly with whatever damage resistance Geralt's armor provides. Meaning if the armor provides 25% resistance to slashing damage then with level 5 it will be 50%.
Some armor sets like high tier Cat School Gear may provide +75% of resistance to a damage type (elemental), in which case the resistance will stack to 100%. While the damage will not be reduced to 0 it shall become so minute that it can be pretty much ignored even on Death March difficulty.
Most notably Bear School Gear can provide +75% resistance against damage from monsters. Which combined with this skill will cause Geralt to become nearly unkillable.
However, not all attacks caused by monsters count as monster damage. For example wraiths wield swords thus they cause slashing damage, alghoul spikes cause piercing damage, while some heavy monsters like golems cause bludgeoning damage.
On a New Game + by using this method it is possible to gain early access to the Runewright's services as the arachnomorphs will not be able to kill Geralt with one hit, thus making it possible to defeat them. However, due to their much higher level their attacks will still deal significant damage but not cause instant death.
The effect will stack with the Griffin decoction, which alone will provide up to 50% resistance against all 5 types of damage without any armor.
At maximum effect combined with Bear School Gear it will provide a minimum of 80% resistance against all 5 damage types. While resistance against monster and slashing damage will reach 100%.
Possibly the best combination is when using Viper School Gear, from Hearts of Stone expansion, as it will provide up to 100% resistance against all damage types except bludgeoning damage, while also providing immunity against poison.
