Demon
A demon is a term used for mysterious beings invoked from other planes. They can take their own form or possess a body of animal or members of the intelligent races. People and animals possessed by demons are known as energumens. It would appear as though demons are not a single race but a catch-all term for creatures of a similar nature, as they are extremely different.
An art of summoning demons is called goetia and is banned by both clergy and Brotherhood of Sorcerers.
In some parts of the known universe, demons are believed to be minions to the god Yrrhedes. In Redania, some speculate that Gaunter O'Dimm, or Master Mirror, is an incomprehensibly powerful demon.
