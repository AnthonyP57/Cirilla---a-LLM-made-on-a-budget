Tor Lara
Tor Lara, also known as The Tower of the Gull, was the fortified peak of Garstang Palace that rose above all the other structures on Thanedd Island.
Due to the metal that surrounded the spire, the tower attracted a great deal of lightning during storms, which could be seen for miles around.
History

Foundation
After the Age of Migration in the 1240s BR, the Aen Seidhe constructed the grand complex and tower atop the rocky island, with the help of magic to lift the heavy stone of which it was built. They constructed a portal in the top of the tower to connect to another elven tower, Tor Zireael.
Brotherhood Takeover
In the late 8th century, after the First Landing of humans, the Brotherhood of Sorcerers took over the palace and began to primarily base their operations from there. Immanuel Benavent, a member of the Brotherhood, later discovered his namesake portal in the tower. Many mages wanted the fame of discovering Tor Zireael, the mythical seat of elven mages and safes, though due to the portal being irreversibly warped, many who went through were chaotically transported to random locations, causing casualties. It was decided to be blocked up, causing protests among the Brotherhood.
Thanedd Coup
On the morning of July 1st 1267, a large-scale coup took place between the Brotherhood, with many siding with the North or Nilfgaard. In the process, the young girl Ciri ran from the conflict through the portal, and due to its unstable nature, was ejected mid-air deep into the Korath desert. Due to this skew, the portal was destroyed, along with the tower, due to a magical explosion at the peak, turning it to rubble.
