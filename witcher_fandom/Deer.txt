Deer
Deer are wild, passive mammals that inhabit most wooded areas throughout the Continent.
They are natural food for wolves, bears, panthers, and other predators. While deer aren't domesticated, some members of the Elder Races are able to ride them.
Members of the human cultures tend to hunt deer for food and fame. They are though protected in some areas, like surrounding of druid circles or royal forests - where only the nobility have a permission to hunt.
Trivia
In the trailer scene for The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, killed creatures can have an actual scent that attracts other monsters in the area. This can lead to natural scenes occurring, like where a hungry bear walks into a pack of wolves busy devouring a deer's carcass.
