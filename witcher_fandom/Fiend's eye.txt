Fiend's eye
Fiend's eye is an alchemy ingredient in The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt. It is not needed to craft anything but can be dismantled into monster eye and monster hair.
It is a random drop from all fiends. In the Blood and Wine expansion, it can also be found as regular random loot in the Witch of Lynx Crag's hut during A Knight's Tales.
