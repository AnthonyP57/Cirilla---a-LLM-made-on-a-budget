Blizzard

The Witcher
Blizzard is one of the most powerful witchers' potions; it improves reflexes and reaction time, allowing a witcher to better parry and evade attacks. It slows down time, making Geralt's movement and everything else slower. It is most helpful against groups of enemies and monsters that move fast or teleport, such as wraiths and various types of vampires.
"Witchers usually drink the Blizzard potion immediately before combat. The potion is also favored in especially dangerous situations."

In a crate in the armoury on the second floor of Kaer Morhen.
Notes
Since it slows down time, this can be very annoying if not in battle.
A bug exists where if the potion is taken before a cutscene, the slow movements can remain active far longer than the potion.
The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt
Blizzard returns as a potion in the third game. Two of these can be crafted at any one time and placed in the consumables slot.

Notes
The effect listed in the infobox here is what the potion actually does, not what is displayed in-game. Multiple patches have changed the in-game description string over the years, but all have been cryptic at best.
