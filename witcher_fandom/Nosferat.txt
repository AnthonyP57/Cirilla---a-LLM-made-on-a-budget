Nosferat
Nosferat or nekurat is a race of vampires which settled in the Northern Kingdoms sometime after the Conjunction of the Spheres which happened in around 230s BR.
They are apparently nocturnal, resembling a bat, and considered more dangerous than katakans. They can, however, take a more humanoid form and live among other races in their civilizations and are obviously intelligent. Unlike alps, bruxae, mulas and Higher Vampires, they are susceptible to sun.
Like other intelligent vampire species, nosferats enjoy drinking blood in smaller or larger doses but don't mutilate their victims by shredding them apart like fleders or ekimmas, leaving only bite marks.
