Necromancy
Necromancy is a subclass of magic which is aimed at casting spells on the dead, whether to reanimate a corpse temporarily for information or to re-live a dead man's last moments, and so forth.
Due to its invasive nature on the dead, as well as potential side effects, the practice is banned by the Brotherhood of Sorcerers.
History
In 1271, Hanmarvyn's Blue Dream, a powerful necromantic ritual, was used on Auckes' corpse by the mage Dethmold and by Geralt to see his last moments of his life.
In 1272, necromancy was used in Freya's Garden by Yennefer on the corpse of Skjall to talk and ask him about Ciri.
