Saesenthessis
I kneel before no one.

Saesenthessis, commonly known as Saskia the Dragonslayer or the Virgin of Aedirn, was a dragon with the ability to take on a human form. She played a crucial role in the Battle of Vergen and, depending on the outcome, became the queen of the independent realm of Upper Aedirn.
Saesenthessis was the daughter of the famous golden dragon Villentretenmerth and the green dragon Myrgtabrakke.

Early life
Saesenthessis was born during the infamous Dragon Hunt, in which a group of individuals sought to kill her mother, the green dragon Myrgtabrakke. The young hatchling was in grave danger after the group poisoned Myrgtabrakke, but a golden dragon, Villentretenmerth, intervened. With a little help, he defeated the attackers. It was revealed that the hatchling was Villentretenmerth's child. After expressing his gratitude to those who aided him, he departed with his newborn daughter.
Villentretenmerth raised Saesenthessis, teaching her everything he knew, including his views on the equality of all life, justice, and honor. He named her Saesenthessis, and she adopted her father's principles as her own. As a crossbreed, with her mother being a green dragon and her father a golden one, she inherited the skill of polymorphism, though her ability was limited—she could only take on a single alternate form, that of a beautiful human maiden.
However, her "childhood" was brief. As was customary among dragons, Villentretenmerth eventually left her to fend for herself. Though this might seem harsh, it was a normal practice among their kind. Young Saesenthessis then began her journey, traveling the world alone.
Life as Saskia
 
During her travels, Saesenthessis encountered Iorveth, an elven commander of a Scoia'tael unit. Although little is known about the details of their meeting, they developed a mutual respect for each other. It was Iorveth who suggested the idea of a fictional alias, leading Saesenthessis to take on a human form and adopt the name Saskia. Together, they crafted her entire backstory—Saskia was said to be from Aedirn, where she had supposedly fought and slain a dragon, earning her the moniker Saskia the Dragonslayer.
Saskia became an influential figure in the kingdom of Aedirn, where she attracted followers of various races and backgrounds. Her ideals of freedom and equality drew the oppressed from far and wide, and she soon became known as the Virgin of Aedirn. She eventually settled in the city of Vergen in the Pontar Valley, where she established a unique community where dwarves, humans, and elves lived together as equals.
Even before King Demavend III of Aedirn was assassinated, Saskia had formed her own militia, consisting of non-humans, burghers, peasants, and sympathetic nobles, initiating a peasant rebellion. Her forces clashed with the royal army loyal to the king, decisively defeating them at the Dyfne. The resulting instability, coupled with the assassination of Demavend III, prompted King Henselt of Kaedwen to invade Upper Aedirn, seeking to claim it for himself. This invasion forced Prince Stennis, along with his remaining noble forces, to join forces with Saskia in Vergen to repel the Kaedweni aggression.
Battle of Vergen

Prelude
 
Around this time, another conflict unfolded. In Temeria, King Foltest laid siege to La Valette Castle. Saskia, who knew the young lord Aryan La Valette and shared his views on equality, left Vergen to assist him. She flew to the battlefield and attacked the king's invading forces. However, after a time, she was driven away, only to return with renewed fury, nearly incinerating the king himself. King Foltest was saved at the last moment by the witcher Geralt of Rivia, who managed to wound her by driving Aerondight into her maw. Injured, Saskia retreated from the battlefield and returned to Vergen.
Shortly after, she and Prince Stennis were invited to negotiate with the invading King Henselt of Kaedwen. As expected, the negotiations were tense and ultimately broke down, culminating in a duel. However, the duel was abruptly interrupted when King Henselt killed a monk named Olcan, whose blood inadvertently activated a dormant curse.
Iorveth's path

Preparations
During that critical moment, a duo entered the fray—the witcher Geralt of Rivia and the Scoia'tael commander Iorveth. They quickly joined the battle, fending off spectral knights and several draugirs. However, for every spectral foe they vanquished, more appeared. Fortunately, they received unexpected assistance from a magical owl, which shielded them and guided the group safely through the spectral mist. Upon reaching the city of Vergen, it was revealed that the owl was none other than the renowned sorceress Philippa Eilhart.
 
 A war council was soon convened to address both the curse and the arrival of Iorveth's Scoia'tael unit. While many members of the council were displeased with Iorveth's presence, viewing him as nothing more than a bandit and murderer, an agreement was eventually reached. Unfortunately, as Saskia raised her chalice for a ceremonial toast, she suddenly collapsed—poisoned. Philippa quickly identified the poison as Thaumador, also known as Magepain, a substance so potent that Saskia's life hung by a thread. The sorceress took Saskia under her care and prepared a list of rare ingredients needed to cure the Virgin of Aedirn. The task of gathering these ingredients fell to the famous witcher, while Iorveth left Vergen to rally more elves to their cause.
As always, Geralt succeeded in his quest, eventually acquiring all the necessary items, including a petal from a rose of remembrance. Philippa used the ingredients to heal Saskia, although she remained weak and needed time to recover. Around this time, Geralt also lifted the curse on the battlefield, clearing the cursed mist and removing the final obstacle to King Henselt's invasion.
In the end, it was revealed that the monk Olcan was responsible for poisoning Saskia.
The battle
When Geralt awoke from the deep sleep induced by the process of lifting the curse, Vergen was already bracing for battle. Saskia briefed the witcher on the situation and assigned him critical tasks to help defend the city. The defenders fought valiantly at the main gate, and with Geralt's assistance, they managed to kill many of the invaders. However, they were heavily outnumbered. To buy time, the defenders used burning oil to devastate the first wave of attackers before retreating to the second gate. Despite regrouping, the Kaedweni forces, led by the sorcerer Dethmold, quickly advanced to the gate and breached it.
Saskia and Geralt fought side by side, repelling one wave after another. However, Saskia soon received alarming news: a group of Kaedweni soldiers, along with Dethmold, had found a way into the mines and intended to use them to launch a surprise attack on Vergen from behind. Saskia decided to take Geralt and intercept them in the mines. Once there, they were ambushed by Dethmold and his men. Outnumbered and nearly defeated, Saskia had no choice but to reveal her true form. As a dragon, she swiftly decimated the soldiers, though Dethmold managed to escape via a portal.
After the battle, Saskia confided in Geralt, revealing the truth about her origins and the need for the Dragonslayer ruse. She also confirmed that she had been the dragon at La Valette Castle and was the one wounded by Geralt's sword. Understanding her reasons, Geralt agreed to keep her secret, and together they returned to the surface to rejoin the battle. With the timely return of Iorveth and his archers, the defenders of Vergen managed to repel the invaders. King Henselt was captured and brought before Saskia and Philippa to negotiate terms of surrender.
Saskia declared the formation of the independent kingdom of the Pontar Valley, with herself as Queen and Philippa as her advisor. Henselt reluctantly agreed to recognize the new state and swore not to invade again. As a final demand, Saskia ordered the execution of the sorcerer Dethmold. With no other option, Henselt consented, and Dethmold was swiftly decapitated. After the execution, Saskia released the king and, along with Philippa, departed for Loc Muinne, where a summit of the Northern Kingdoms was being held.
However, Dethmold's execution did not go unnoticed by Saskia's followers, particularly Iorveth, who was troubled by her actions. He had never imagined that Saskia would take a prisoner's life without due process. Suspicious of her behavior, Iorveth, along with Geralt, decided to investigate Philippa's quarters for any evidence. They discovered the recipe for the Thaumador poison and realized that it did not originally include the Rose of Remembrance. By adding the petal, Philippa had secretly bound Saskia's will to her own, effectively controlling her.
Enraged by this discovery, Iorveth decided to travel to Loc Muinne to confront Philippa, with Geralt accompanying him as usual.
Roche's path

Preparations
In this version of events, Geralt arrived at the scene of the duel accompanied by Vernon Roche, the commander of the Temerian special forces known as the Blue Stripes. Together, they joined forces with King Henselt and his sorcerer, Dethmold. With Dethmold's magical assistance, they were able to navigate through the spectral mist safely, eventually reaching the Kaedweni camp.
To lift the curse that plagued the battlefield, Geralt needed the same specific items. This task led him to the city of Vergen, where he encountered Saskia herself. During their meeting, Saskia, impressed by Geralt's reputation and skill, offered him a place at her side in the defense of Vergen. However, due to his obligations and perhaps conflicting allegiances, Geralt was forced to decline her offer.
Despite the challenges, Geralt successfully acquired all the necessary items to lift the curse. With the mist dispelled, the path was cleared for King Henselt's forces to launch a full-scale assault on Vergen.
The battle
After a series of events at Henselt's camp, Geralt and Roche ultimately chose to join the battle for Vergen on the side of the defenders. Despite their efforts, the defending forces were quickly overwhelmed by the superior numbers and strength of Henselt's army. The battle was eventually lost, with Henselt emerging victorious.
However, despite his triumph, Henselt was unable to capture either Saskia or her advisor, the sorceress Philippa Eilhart. The duo managed to escape the battlefield by fleeing to Loc Muinne through a portal, eluding Henselt's grasp.
Loc Muinne summit
Shortly after arriving in the city of Loc Muinne, Philippa Eilhart was arrested by the king of Redania, Radovid V, known as Radovid the Stern. Despite her deep desire to assist her mistress, Saskia was unable to intervene and was forced to retreat alongside another sorceress, Síle de Tansarville, an ally of Philippa.
Due to the binding spell, Saskia was filled with anxiety and driven by a strong urge to rescue Philippa. However, Síle advised her to remain patient and focus on preparing for the upcoming Summit.
Iorveth's path
Iorveth and Geralt arrived in Loc Muinne before the Summit, only to discover that Philippa Eilhart had been arrested. Determined to free Saskia from Philippa's spell, they decided to locate the sorceress and persuade her to lift the enchantment. Geralt eventually uncovered that Philippa was being held in a dungeon under the control of the Redanian forces. There, she was brutally interrogated by King Radovid V, who ordered her eyes to be gouged out. Blinded and weakened, Philippa was found by Geralt, who swiftly defeated her guards before confronting the sorceress herself.
If Geralt decides to help Philippa: Geralt chose to assist Philippa, agreeing to help her reach her house in exchange for a magical dagger that could lift the spell binding Saskia. Despite Philippa's inevitable betrayal once they arrived, Geralt managed to survive the encounter and successfully acquired the dagger. With this, he was prepared to attend the Summit.
If Geralt decides not to help Philippa: Geralt, after a tense exchange with the blinded Philippa, decided that rescuing his lover and friend Triss Merigold was more important. He left Philippa to fend for herself and instead captured the Nilfgaardian ambassador Shilard Fitz-Oesterlen. Philippa was left to her own devices.
During the Summit, Saskia presented her proposal for the independent kingdom of Pontar Valley, declaring herself as its Queen. Backed by King Henselt and the sorceress Síle de Tansarville, her proposal gained the Summit's approval, and Saskia's realm was recognized. However, the Summit was soon disrupted by the entrance of the Order of the Flaming Rose knights, who were there to ensure peaceful negotiations.
It was then revealed that Síle, Philippa, and other members of the secretive Lodge of Sorceresses were responsible for the recent assassinations of northern kings. Realizing she had no escape, Síle summoned Saskia in her true form—a dragon. In the ensuing chaos, the dragon rescued Síle and flew away, but they were pursued by Geralt.
 
 Geralt eventually confronted the dragon, and after a fierce battle, he managed to mount her. Despite Saesenthessis's efforts to throw him off, Geralt caused the dragon to crash into a broken tree, leaving her severely injured and unable to continue the fight. Geralt was then faced with a critical decision: spare the dragon, end her life, or lift the curse binding her to Philippa's will.
If Geralt kills the dragon: The witcher, deeming the dragon too dangerous to be left alive, delivered a decisive blow with his sword, ending the life of the great Saesenthessis.
If Geralt spares the dragon: The witcher chose to adhere to his code, sparing the life of the magnificent creature. He left Saesenthessis behind and returned to the city, allowing her to live.
If Geralt lifts the curse: Geralt decided to lift the curse, using the magical dagger to pierce the dragon. The enchantment broke, and Saesenthessis transformed back into her human form as Saskia. Free from the spell and healed from her wounds, she thanked Geralt. She revealed more about herself, including that her father was the Golden Dragon Villentretenmerth, an old friend of Geralt's. After exchanging farewells, they each went their separate ways—Geralt returned to Loc Muinne, while Saskia made her way back to Vergen.
Roche's path
 
In this version, Geralt arrived at Loc Muinne in the company of Vernon Roche. He remained unaware of Philippa's involvement and had never encountered the Dragonslayer, Saskia, until the summit itself. During the meeting, when Síle de Tansarville was exposed as a member of the Lodge of Sorceresses, she summoned Saskia in her true form as a dragon. The dragon caused chaos, rescuing Síle from the blaze, and they attempted to flee. However, Geralt pursued them, determined to stop the devastation.
Eventually, Geralt confronted the dragon. In the heat of battle, he gained the upper hand by anchoring himself to Saesenthessis with his steel sword. Despite her attempts to shake him off, Geralt's relentless persistence prevailed. He managed to force the dragon down, where she became impaled on a broken tree. With the mighty Saesenthessis gravely injured and unable to continue fighting, Geralt faced a critical decision: to spare the dragon's life or end it.
If Geralt kills the dragon: The witcher determined that allowing the dragon to live would be too dangerous. With a powerful strike from his sword, he ended the suffering of the great Saesenthessis, bringing her life to a tragic close.
If Geralt spares the dragon: The witcher chose to adhere to his code, refusing to kill such a magnificent creature. He spared the dragon's life, leaving her behind and returning to the city.
The Third Northern War
 
After the events at Loc Muinne, Saskia returned to Vergen and revealed her true nature as a dragon. The residents of Vergen had mixed reactions—many chose to leave the city, while others remained, watching her closely.
Still recovering from the effects of Philippa Eilhart's spell, Saskia, while in her dragon form, unintentionally killed a group of dwarves during an initial expedition against the Chelonodrake, an effort to reopen an old mine to bolster the young realm's finances. The next morning, in her human form, she returned to Vergen and publicly vowed never to transform into a dragon again.
Three weeks later, Saskia and Yarpen Zigrin approached Geralt about the Chelonodrake and persuaded him to help them slay the monster. Five days later, she, Geralt, Eggar, Maevarienn, and Yarpen devised a plan to kill the beast.
Two days after that, the group, joined by Barclay Els, embarked on their final expedition against the Chelonodrake. After they succeeded in defeating the monster, Saskia broke her earlier promise and transformed into a dragon to quickly transport the severely wounded Barclay to dwarven medics. Sadly, despite her efforts, she arrived too late to save him. Overcome with guilt, Saskia decided to leave Vergen.
Some time later, Saskia encountered Geralt in a jungle. They shared a conversation around a campfire, during which she ultimately decided to return to Vergen to help its residents fend off the advancing Nilfgaardian forces. However, during the early stages of the Third Northern War, the Nilfgaardian Army swiftly conquered all the northern territories up to the Pontar river, including Upper Aedirn, effectively ending Saskia's independent realm. While it was rumored that Saskia did not survive the fall of Vergen, she in fact retreated and remained alive and well for the remainder of the war.
Skills and capabilities
As a crossbred dragon, Saesenthessis was very strong, possessing flight common to her species, ability to absorb magical energy, breathing fire, and using her weight to destroy buildings with her fangs, claws, and tail. As a dragon cross between a green dragon mother and a golden dragon father, Saesenthessis had her mother's skillful flying and her father's ability to shapeshift.
When fighting in human form, Saesenthessis wore full body armor, and wielding a longsword and a heater shield.
The Witcher Battle Arena
 
Saskia was one of the playable heroes in the now defunct MOBA.
Hero Presentation
They don't call her Dragon Warrior for nothing! Saskia is a powerful melee fighter who can stun her opponents with a powerful shield bash, but she is also very able in the use of dragon flame magical attacks. Thanks to her unusual origin, she feels best when engulfed in fire. Her passive skill, Hidden Dragon, allows her to regenerate thrice as fast as usual when standing in flames. She is also pretty resistant which makes her a natural tank – a fighter who keeps enemies busy and can withstand a lot of damage.
Shieldstrike – Saskia's main skill is a short charge which culminates with a shield bash, which stuns the enemy for a short while. The charge leaves a flaming trail that activates Saskia's passive skill and deals damage over time to everyone standing in it. Shieldstrike is an awesome ability to initiate fights, but it can also be used to escape from a tight situation.
By Sword and Fire is a skillshot ability (i.e. one that has to be carefully aimed). Saskia prepares for a short while and then smashes the ground to create a wave of flame, that travels ahead dealing damage to everything on the way. The skill also leaves a flaming path on the ground, dealing damage over time.
Dragon Soul – Saskia's special skill is a powerful area attack. The heroine explodes with fire, creating eight waves of flame that radially erupt from where she's standing. The waves work like By Sword and Fire and activate Saskia's passive ability, and deal damage both on impact and over time.
Notes
She reveals to Geralt that when it comes to sexual preferences, she prefers dwarves.
