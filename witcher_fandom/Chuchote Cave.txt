Map description
To listen to the old folks' jabber, this place was once home to Whispess – a woodland witch eager to help any in need. When Whispess peered into a certain knight's heart, she saw that it was black and refused him aid. The knight reacted with wrath and burned the witch alive in her cave. Soon afterward, the knight went mad and killed himself – claiming he was tortured by a strange voice whispering in his ear that no one else could hear.
Trivia
Chuchoter means "to whisper" in French (chuchote is an inflected form). Reminiscent of the name of the witch Whispess who once lived in this cave.
