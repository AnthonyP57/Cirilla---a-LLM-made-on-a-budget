Illusion
An illusion is a magically created simulation of a phenomenon, whether physical or perceptual, that is either to conceal, distort, provide enticement, or be made to be interacted with.
An illusion can be cast using complex magic to create whole new environments, like when Artorius Vigo used extremely powerful magic to create the Land of a Thousand Fables, while Stregobor used an interactive illusion inside his tower to create nude women tending to apple trees.
However, smaller illusions can be cast as well with the help of a magical object, such as merely to hide an entrance or distort reality, like the medallion Fringilla Vigo gave Geralt. Despite these illusions not being as grand, they can be quite effective during a fight and which Geralt used to great effect twice.
Notes
In The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, many basic illusions can be dispelled with The Eye of Nehaleni.
