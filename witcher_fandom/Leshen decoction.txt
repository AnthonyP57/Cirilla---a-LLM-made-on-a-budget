Tips
Unlike most "punishment" effects, the potion will do the exact same damage regardless of how much damage Geralt receives when struck by an enemy. So even if he is hit while under the effects of Quen, the enemy will still receive all the reflected damage despite Geralt not taking any damage himself.
As of Patch 4.0 this only appears to apply to the 10 damage effect, while the 10% will only be returned if Geralt takes damage accordingly.
