Seven gnomes
The seven gnomes were a robber band from Mahakam whom were later joined by Renfri, also known as Shrike. They robbed merchants at first until one day when the gnomes began an argument amongst themselves so violent none of them made it out alive save for the princess. After that, Renfri put together a band of her own.
Notes
The group appears in The Hexer TV series episode "Człowiek - pierwsze spotkanie".
In the Geralt comic, one of the members of the band is Yarpen Zigrin, despite him being a dwarf.
