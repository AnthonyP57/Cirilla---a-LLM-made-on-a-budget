The Witcher 3 main quests
This page is a finding aid which lists all main quests in The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt first by chapter, and then in the order in which they normally are started within the chapter but can be sorted alphabetically for searching. Each quest will only appear in the chapter where it starts, even if the quest persists through more than one chapter. To see a quest walkthrough, click on the quest name.
