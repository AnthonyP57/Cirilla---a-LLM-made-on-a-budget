Field Marshal Windbag
"Kin' 'ell!" the parrot squawked."Shut your beak," Zoltan Chivay growled at the bird. "Excuse me. This foreign bird is clever but vulgar. I paid ten thalers for the freak. He's called Field Marshal Windbag."
- pg. 76 Baptism of Fire (U.K. edition)
Field Marshal Windbag (Polish: Feldmarszałek Duda), was a talking parrot, originally owned by Zoltan Chivay, who purchased him for ten thalers. They were inseparable and everywhere the dwarf went, Field Marshall Windbag accompanied him perched on his shoulder. The parrot's vocabulary consisted mainly of some rather salty phrases.
After the Second Northern War, Zoltan sold the bird to the gnome, Percival Schuttenbach. Percival opened a jewellers workshop in Novigrad, where he used the parrot as a living advertisement. In Polish, the parrot's cry was described as "Brrrylanty! Brrrylanty!" which sounds just like "Brilliants! Brilliants!" which would certainly be an improvement in its vocabulary.
Notes
In The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, he appears on an advertisement poster for Percival Schuttenbach's Shop in Novigrad but since it is closed, he does not appear in the game itself.
