Blue Stripes
When King Foltest answered Henselt's request for aid with twenty foot soldiers from the Blue Stripes commando, Henselt grew furious. What difference could they possible make... ? Well. As it turned out, an enormous one.

The Blue Stripes was an elite Special Forces unit in the Temerian military. From 1267, the unit was commanded by Vernon Roche, a former peasant that rose through the ranks to become one of King Foltest's most trusted military leaders. His second-in-command was Ves, a highly trained archer and arbalist.
The unit consisted of dauntless tattooed swashbucklers, interrogation specialists, noiseless scouts – all of them extremely loyal to their leader.
History

Raid on La Valette Castle

Flotsam
If Geralt aided the Blue Stripes: Roche, Geralt, and the unit rode to Flotsam. There they discovered Bernard Loredo's deception with Kaedwen and Roche, disgusted by the man's treachery, decided to thwart his plans and raid his mansion. With Geralt's help, the Blue Stripes succeeded and not much later set sail to support Henselt in his campaign against Saskia.
Unfortunately, during their stay at Henselt's side, the whole unit was accused for conspiracy and hanged on Dethmold's order.
If Geralt aided the Scoia'tael: without the witcher's aid, Vernon's plan of overthrowing Bernard Loredo had no chance of success thus the unit had to flee Flotsam.

Notes
Special unit forces, like the Blue Stripes, are known of their efficiency and ruthlessness. Their members are mostly people who have "nothing to lose", enjoy "hunting non-humans", and are often treated as "human Scoia'tael".
