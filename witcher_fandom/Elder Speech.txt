Elder Speech
Hen Llinge, or Elvish, is the language of the Aen Seidhe elves. As it is one of the oldest languages still in use, it is referred to as the Old or Elder Speech while the lingua franca is Common Speech. It is used not only by elves, but also by mages and scholars. Sung versions of Elder Speech are used by dryads, sirens, and nereids. Nilfgaardian, Skellige and Zerrikanian dialects all derive from Elder Speech.
Real world origins
Its vocabulary is based heavily on the Celtic languages of Wales, Ireland, and Scotland, although in some cases Sapkowski has used also connotations with more "popular" languages, like German and English. The two basic verbs, "to be" and "to have", are borrowed from Italian and Latin.
The author invented the language for orcs and elves, but so far only the latter have appeared in the official continuity.
For the purpose of Netflix's The Witcher, renowned linguist David J. Peterson recreated the Elder Speech as a fully developed constructed language. In contrast with Sapkowski's writings, Peterson's latinization of the language reflects the intended pronunciation in the show, leaving the irregularities to the language's native script (which he had also invented). For example, inváerne is latinized as inveirne and Hen Llinge as Hen Linge.
Note: for the purposes of consistency with the Saga and the games, words coined for the TV series listed below follow the transliteration from Elder Runes rather than Peterson's romanization. For the latter, visit Hen Linge page on the linguist's wiki.
