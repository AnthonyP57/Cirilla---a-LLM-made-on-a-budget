Golden Oriole
Golden Oriole is an elixir used mainly by witchers and mages to treat poisoning from many sources, such as corpse-venom from a graveir.
The Witcher
"Before fighting a venomous creature like the basilisk, a witcher drinks Golden Oriole to release enzymes that increase his resistance to toxins. The truly cautious prepare a second dose in case an opponents' poison somehow overcomes this resistance."
Golden Oriole renders a witcher's body immune to poison and neutralizes the effects of poisons already present in his bloodstream.

Journal entry
Golden Oriole, one of the best-known witcher potions, increases resistance to special attacks, such as Poisoning, Incineration and Bleeding. The brew also negates the side effects of the Lapwing and Brock potions, while producing no side effects of its own. The potion increases Toxicity slightly when imbibed.
Golden Oriole is recommended before fighting monsters that employ powerful special attacks. It is effective against venomous and fire breathing creatures, as well as those that cause Bleeding.
The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt
Golden Oriole returns as a potion in the third game. Three of these can be crafted at any one time and placed in the consumables slot.
It provides complete immunity to many poison attacks and hazards that are otherwise very dangerous, including any "poison spit" type monster attacks and noxious gas in the environment.
