Tips
Dimeritium ore is required to craft enriched dimeritium ore which is required to craft grandmaster witcher gear sets.
Some higher tier swords contain dimeritium ingots which can be dismantled into ore. However, since dimeritium ingots are required for lower tier witcher sets, they should only be dismantled as a last resort.
