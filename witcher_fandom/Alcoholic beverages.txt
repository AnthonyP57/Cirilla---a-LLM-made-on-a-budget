Alcoholic beverages
In The Witcher, alcoholic beverages are a subset of alcohol that varies between weak and medium strength and can not be used as potion bases; they are strictly for Geralt's drinking pleasure, to be used as gifts, or are quest requirements.
Beer
Beer is the weakest and also the least expensive of the alcoholic beverages available in The Witcher. It comes in five varieties.
