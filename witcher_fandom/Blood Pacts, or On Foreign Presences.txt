Journal entry
Whosoever summons a Visitant into our Realm risks much. Whether flickering as a Spirit in the ether or inhabiting the Flesh of a designated Host, the Visitant shall strive to attain its Liberty, and if it does, it shall wreak great havoc. Thus a Visitant must be summoned only within a protective Circle, which shall bind it as no fetters could.
The Circle must be complete and eternal, with no ruptures. Its line must be drawn with a steady hand firmly gripping the chalk. Since a stray step, made through carelessness or the Visitant's trickery, can smudge the line, the Circle must be further secured by a barrier in the form of lit candles made of beeswax. A Circle thus protected shall stand as a sure and inescapable Prison for the Visitant.

Notes
This book describes the ritual used by Olgierd von Everec to summon Gaunter O'Dimm, but there appears to be a contradiction between the closing sentence "A Circle thus protected shall stand as a sure and inescapable Prison for the Visitant." and how the said Circle is depicted in both Olgierd's scene and how Professor Shakeslock uses it. That is, the most straightforward interpretation would be that the Circle is supposed to be a prison for the Visitant, not a mere protective shield against his powers.
