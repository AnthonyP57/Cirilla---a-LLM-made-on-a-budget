Malus Island
Malus Island, also known as the Isle of Avallach or Isle of Avalon, is most likely located somewhere in the mists of Loch Eskalott. It is there that Ciri took Geralt and Yennefer, to save them after the riots in Rivia in 1268. After Ciri left their world, they resided together on the isle in a house with an orchard. Eventually the Wild Hunt came to Malus Island on the trail of Ciri and attacked, burning the house and orchard and making off with Yennefer as prisoner. Determined to rescue her, Geralt left the island in search of the Hunt and Yennefer.
Trivia
The name of the island in Polish is "Wyspa Jabłoni". "Jabłoni" is the equivalent of the apple genus Malus. In Arthurian legends, the island of Avalon (the Celtic word for "apple") was known for its beautiful apples and the Lady of the Lake is often associated with the scent of apples. This particular theme is revisited many times in Sapkowski's works.
