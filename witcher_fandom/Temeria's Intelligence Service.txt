Temeria's Intelligence Service
Temeria's Intelligence Service is the intelligence agency of Temeria, mainly based in the city of Vizima.
Expanded greatly by King Foltest in the 13th century, they were responsible for the capture of wanted peoples, delivering messages, and transferring news of the war.
History

Medell's Reign
At some point in 1226, agents of the Intelligence Service infiltrated Aedirnian Special Forces stationed in Aldersberg, and made an unsuccessful attempt on the life of underage Prince Demavend III, an act meant to be Medell's revenge for the shameful defeat Virfuril handed him near Hagge.
Foltest's Reign
In 1267, after Foltest met with the other northern rulers at Hagge, spies from the service heard news of the mage Rience tracking Ciri, the princess of Cintra who was orphaned in the capital's slaughter. Believing that Nilfgaard was attempting to capture the girl, they began a continent wide search to hunt down and kill her as that stopped Nilfgaard's control of succession. Later during the search, they approached the "lawyer" Codringher in Dorian for advice, who falsely told them Ciri had died in Angren to throw them off her tail.
Concurrently, in an attempt to lure out Rience, Foltest ordered the agency to capture Geralt of Rivia as bait. In Acorn Bay, agents Stran, Vitek and another man pretended to be arresting Geralt for travelling with and having indecent relations with a young girl, though this proved useless as the agents were killed by an aeschna that attacked out of the Pontar Delta.
