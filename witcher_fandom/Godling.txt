Godling
Godling (Polish: bożątko) is a rare being capable of communicating in the common tongue.
They typically resemble a human child, except they have big bright eyes and pale blue skin.
Some godlings are known to tattoo themselves and they wear little when it comes to clothes apart from some adornments. Godlings usually live in woody and swampy areas, and aren't afraid of living close to monsters like drowners. They are easily confused with a bucca or lutin, and can be hurt (or killed) by an herb called Burdock.

Bestiary entry
Not too long ago the areas around peasant hamlets were chock full of guardian spirits. Today it's nigh unto impossible to spot a brownie, bucca or lutin. And godlings, they are always the first to go. Such is the price we pay for civilization's forward march.– From the preface to "The World We Have Lost," by Professor Dorregaray
Godlings (sometimes mistaken for lutin) are woodland creatures dwelling in burrows and moss-covered hollow stumps on the outskirts of human settlements. They are similar to children in behavior and appearance, and, like children, delight in mischief. Godlings are deeply rooted in their home territory and perform acts of care and guardianship to those dwelling near their burrows. They watch over people as well as animals, but, shy creatures by nature, they try to do so while remaining unseen. Godlings are drawn to joy and innocence, and so delight in the company of children and usually only show themselves to the young.
These hard-working and clever creatures gladly perform small services for those in their care, asking only for respect and payment in the form of food or cast-off tools in return. They are easily offended by churlish, ungrateful or simply rude behavior. Godlings also treasure their peace and quiet. When the village a godling watches over becomes too populous or its inhabitants forget the old ways, it will abandon its burrow for good and walk off to destinations unknown.
Trivia
Bożątko, as the godling is known in the native version of the game, is the diminutive form of ubożę or bożęta. It is the name of a usually benignant house spirit from Polish mythology, said to originate from the souls of deceased ancestors. This creature appears in the folklore of other Slavic countries as well but sometimes under different names, e.g. in Russian lands it was known as a domovik or domovoy.
