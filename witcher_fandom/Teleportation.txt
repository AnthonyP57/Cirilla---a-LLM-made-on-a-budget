Teleportation
Teleportation is the magical displacement of beings or objects from one place to another. Sometimes this is achieved with a magic spell, but other times facilitating objects are used. Portals are an example of teleportation devices or passages. An example is the portal connecting the two towers of Tor Lara and Tor Zireael.
Many individuals, such as Geralt, perceive teleportation as dangerous. Not without a reason – not counting potentially missing body parts, the travel itself is risky as it is done through a strange realm where the time, heat, light and matter do not exist. Creatures from material plane trapped here are scarred and if they remain here too long they can become insane. If one is lost it is extremely hard to bring them back and only certain practitioners like Krepp claim they can try.
The Witcher
Triss uses teleportation a few times in the course of the game.
Wiedźmin: Gra Wyobraźni
Teleportation is a spell which can be used by the player to travel up to 5 km, but it does come at a dangerous cost.
