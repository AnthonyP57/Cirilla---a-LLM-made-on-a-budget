Wolf School Gear
As part of week 5's DLC for The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, we now have a Scavenger Hunt for the Wolf School Gear, released on the 18th of June 2015. It was what many players of the game wished to see introduced, as all other witcher schools got their own armor set. The set includes chest armor, steel and silver swords, gauntlets, boots, and trousers, all of which are upgradeable, and all legendary gear are stronger versions of base game gear in New Game +.
The armor style is very similar to that of Eskel's and that of other witchers of the School of the Wolf - layered jackets made of leather and reinforced with metal studs/rivets. The mastercrafted and grandmaster versions further reinforce the outer jacket with panels of mail armor and metal spaulders on the shoulders.
Due to the basic mastercrafted Wolf sets being downloadable content, the grandmaster equipment added in Blood and Wine expansion doesn't require the mastercrafted versions for it to be made like the Griffin, Bear, and Cat school grandmaster equipment.
Bonus for 3 pieces: Each instance of Bleeding applied to enemies increases sword damage by 1% for each piece of the set.
Bonus for 6 pieces: Each Adrenaline Point increases the possible number of Bleeding effects that can be applied to a single enemy.

Notes
With the exception of grandmaster-level gear, unlike other witcher school sets, the legendary versions of Wolven equipment have distinct global item IDs. Thus, while only obtainable via console commands or mods, they aren't aren't technically exclusive to New Game +.
