The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt
Unlike previous games, Vitriol is not simply part of other alchemical ingredients and is its own item. It is needed to craft the following items:
Blue armor dye 
Lesser blue mutagen 
Blue mutagen 
Greater blue mutagen 
Superior Swallow
Superior White Honey
Turquoise armor dye 
Unlike other alchemical substances of its kind, while it is still necessary to craft early in the game, Vitriol can also be reliably found more than once:
In 5 crates at Kaer Morhen's main hall, appearing at the start of The Battle of Kaer Morhen (each crate has 50% chance to have vitriol, but you'll know them for always having balisse fruit, berbercane fruit, crow's eye and white myrtle petals)
In the medic's tent at the Tourney Grounds in Toussaint
In the Blood and Wine expansion, it can also be purchased from alchemists:
Merchant at the Perfumery
Wine Merchant at Chuchote Cave, after completing his quest
Wine Merchant at Dun Tynne Hillside, after completing his quest
Trivia
Vitriol is an archaic name for sulfate. The name comes from Latin "vitreolum", which means "glassy".
