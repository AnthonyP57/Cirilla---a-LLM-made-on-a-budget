The Witcher 3 secondary quests
Secondary quests in The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt are not contracts or treasure hunts and can be as simple as talking to someone or in-depth as running around hunting down clues and people in multiple locations.
In most circumstances you are able to leave and resume secondary quests at any time but make sure to read a quest's page for any restrictions or time constraints.

Notes
The Whispering Hillock is one of the only quests in the game that is classified as both main and secondary, depending on how it's found. If found before progressing far enough in the main story line, it'll show up as secondary. Otherwise, it'll eventually show up as a required (main) quest further along in the story.
