Map description
The history of the von Everec estate is as tangled as that of the family itself. The once wealthy Redanian family's manor and lands were auctioned off after they fell deeply in debt, but were returned to von Everec hands by Olgierd, the infamous leader of an informal band of armed men calling themselves the Redanian Free Company. Despite the effort he went through to regain it, Olgierd abandoned the residence some time later, and dark legends concerning it now circulate among its neighbors.
