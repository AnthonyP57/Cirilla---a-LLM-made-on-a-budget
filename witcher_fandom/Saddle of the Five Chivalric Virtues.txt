Saddle of the Five Chivalric Virtues
Saddle of the Five Chivalric Virtues is a piece of horse equipment in the Blood and Wine expansion that adds +90 to Roach's stamina.
It can be purchased from any armorer in Toussaint.
If Geralt chooses to kill Iocaste during the secondary quest Mutual of Beauclair's Wild Kingdom, and after the Trading Post is then repaired, it may also be found as loot, in a big chest near the armorer there.
