Embodiment of the Five Virtues
Embodiment of the Five Virtues is an achievement in the Blood and Wine expansion and requires one to complete enough tasks (and fight the Hermit) to then be given Aerondight.
This can technically be missable as first you have to start the secondary quest There Can Be Only One, and there are a limited number of tasks that count towards each of the 5 virtues, though there's so many, you'll likely get one of each soon enough.
Tips
You only need to get 1 of each virtue
For a complete list of actions that count towards each virtue, see the quest page There Can Be Only One
